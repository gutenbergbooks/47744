<h2><a name="chI" id="chI"></a>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>BORN TO BEAUTY</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Evarne</span> Stornway hurried across the fields towards
Heatherington at a speed that deprived her gait
of much of that graceful yet somewhat insolent
sway that caused it to be alike the butt and the
envy of the other youthful females of the neighbourhood.
Not an hour since she had first heard beyond a doubt the
gentle rustling of the wings of the Angel of Death within
the sick-room of her father, and, goaded by cruel anxiety,
she was&mdash;even against the invalid&#39;s will&mdash;seeking medical
aid.</p>

<p class="indent">The rapid walk brought brightness to eyes and cheeks,
thereby doing much to restore that subtle air of perfect
health and happiness that usually added so much to the
girl&#39;s beauty. But always was Evarne fair to behold; her
dark eyes, so large and limpid, were expressive and intense;
her lips, alluring in curves and colour, spoke to
the &quot;seeing eye&quot; of both kindliness and individuality.
Yet she could have dispensed with all the charm given by
mental grace, and still riveted attention, for she possessed
loveliness of that type, supreme above all others, that is
independent of expression&mdash;the beauty of grace, symmetry
of form, and faultless feature. And for this she had been
taught to thank&mdash;not chance, not merely heredity, but
the determination of her father.</p>

<p class="indent">Leopold Stornway had a passionate adoration for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
physical beauty, regarding it as almost the first of virtues.
And more, he was proud of the vast importance he placed
on bodily perfection, for was it not a reverence characteristic
of classic Greece? There it was&mdash;in the records of
the never-to-be-forgotten days of antiquity&mdash;that Leo
found all his chief interests. Egypt, Mesopotamia, Rome,
and, above all, Greece&mdash;each in turn had been the lands of
his adoption. Pericles and Cæsar, Cyrus and Rameses,
Shalmanesur and Hiram, were the gods of his idolatry.
He knew and cared more concerning the triumphant
fortunes of Semiramis; the proceedings of Antigone or of
Theseus; the adventures of Agamemnon or Achilles, of
Hector or the pious Æneas at the Siege of Troy, than he
did of the doings of those who sat in the seats of the mighty
in his own century.</p>

<p class="indent">The happiest time of his life had been his three years at
Oxford. Almost immediately on leaving college he married&mdash;simply
because she was beautiful as any Greek statue&mdash;a
young woman considerably beneath him in station, and
possessed of an unconquerably violent temper. He knew
right well, even during the period of his deepest infatuation,
that he had found no mate for his soul. He was sadly
conscious that that part of his mind&mdash;of his spirit&mdash;that
he cared for most deeply, never would&mdash;never could&mdash;unveil
itself to the scrutiny of his chosen life-long companion.</p>

<p class="indent">To feed his intellectual affections, he relied on the continuance
of his college friendship with the brilliant and
vivacious Morris Kenyon. But herein he was doomed to
disappointment. After a brief spell of vain struggling for
literary recognition in London, Leo settled down, contentedly
enough, to obscurity in the depth of the country.
There he spent peaceful days occupied in highly intellectual
yet miserably paid writings. Each year he became more
of a recluse&mdash;more out of touch with the times. Morris
Kenyon likewise altered. Plunged into the vortex of town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
life, seeing and doing everything, going everywhere,
courted and flattered and popular, not only on account of
his great wealth but for his more personal attractions&mdash;every
year he drifted farther from being the Morris of yore.
The change in both men was but gradual, and through
varying stages of disillusion and disappointment, their
ardent friendship was long in dying. But the time came
when all ended&mdash;even correspondence ceased.</p>

<p class="indent">Leo&#39;s marriage was more successful. His wife made
strenuous efforts to rise to his heights, while his admiration
of her stately loveliness never waned. Their first child was
a boy, who died in infancy, but ere long little Evarne came
as consoler. Leo had wished for a daughter, and had
always spoken of the expected baby by the Greek name
he had already chosen for her&mdash;Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">He had strong theories on pre-natal influence, and put
them into practice. He read and discussed with his wife
poetry and the noblest prose works. Everywhere she
turned her eyes in her home she beheld representations of
female beauty&mdash;magnificent or placid. On the wall of her
bed-chamber was a barbaric, richly-hued painting of a
Babylonian slave-market. It showed a group of women
decking themselves before entering the Market Square,
which could be seen through an opening of the tent. They
were of many nationalities, but each in her own way represented
physically perfect womanhood.</p>

<p class="indent">Near to this hung a contrasting picture&mdash;a delicate
symphony in blue and gold and snowy white. It was the
Catholic&#39;s Madonna, with placid lips and large uplifted
eyes that told of thoughts beyond this world&mdash;chaste,
calm and pure.</p>

<p class="indent">In the corner of the room by the window stood a large
cast of a famous antique nude statue of Venus. So perfect
was it&mdash;the glorious muscles of the body dimpling so gently,
so graciously&mdash;that even Leo&#39;s unimaginative wife could
find and feel something of what is soothing and peace-giving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
in such beauty. Sometimes of an early morning a narrow
beam of light would creep into the darkened room between
the drawn curtains and illuminate just this statue. Then
the young wife, lying wakeful, would fix her eyes on the form
of the Goddess of Beauty, drinking in its divine influence,
remembering her husband&#39;s assurance that its contemplation
would go far towards making the little daughter
that was to come likewise strong and beautiful.</p>

<p class="indent">And Leo&#39;s words proved not untrue&mdash;a more lovely baby
never saw the light. But Evarne&#39;s birth cost the mother
her life, and after five years of happy marriage, Leo was
once again lonely.</p>

<p class="indent">Since the child&#39;s upbringing was thus left to her father,
with his fads and fancies, it was naturally of a unique
nature. Mrs. Jarman&mdash;the worthy matron whom he
engaged to act as nurse to his child, and cook-housekeeper
to himself&mdash;was wont to declare, both to her gentleman
in person and to the village in general, that she was sure
Providence had seen fit to appoint a special angel to guard
that blessed motherless mite; otherwise no mortal woman
could possibly have succeeded in rearing it.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Stornway <i>would</i> interfere in what Mrs. Jarman held
to be no concern of any man&mdash;not even of a father. First
of all he had been divided in opinion as to whether the
infant should be wrapped in swaddling-clothes in true
classical style, or should remain in equally classical nudity.
The baby had arrived in the summer-time, so the latter
idea prevailed, and to Mrs. Jarman&#39;s dismay the little one
passed the first few months of its existence clad in very
little more than its own silky skin. All the experienced
dame&#39;s traditional ideas of long robes, binders, shortening-clothes,
teething-rings, etc., were swept aside as <i>modern</i>.
Thus they were unworthy of a Greek reincarnation, named
after the fairest of the Nereides, and destined to show an
altogether degenerate world what beauty had been in the
glorious days of old. With the approaching chill of winter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
even Mr. Stornway agreed to the little form being warmly
clad, but his aversion to modern fashions never could be
uprooted.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, though Evarne, as she now hastened to summon
the doctor to her father&#39;s dying bed, was nigh seventeen, she
had never owned a pair of corsets, or worn a dress more
tight-fitting than could be managed by shaping the material
into the waist by gauging or smocking. Indoors, she invariably
cast aside her shoes and stockings. She could
carry burdens on her head, could run, jump, and swim with
the ease and lightness of a young Amazon. She slept
soundly on a bed hard as wood, and had never been indulged
to the extent of a pillow in her life. Of her own accord she
would never have chosen such a harsh <i>régime</i>. But at
sixteen she knew but this one mode of existence, and habit
rendered it congenial enough.</p>

<h2><a name="chII" id="chII"></a>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>A FRIEND IN NEED</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dr. Crossways</span> was at home, and at once set
out with the girl for &quot;The Retreat.&quot; He was a
surly old man, and, moreover, he had a particularly
annoying habit&mdash;of which no amount of
gentle correction could break him&mdash;of pronouncing Evarne&#39;s
name without the final &quot;e,&quot; thus compressing it into two
syllables instead of three, as it is in the musical tongue of
ancient Greece, whence the name was taken. As a rule,
the doctor was morose and silent, but on this occasion he
had at least one piece of gossip to enlarge upon.</p>

<p class="indent">On the previous day he had indulged himself in a holiday
on the strength of an invitation from the noble lord who
had rented the shooting on a big estate some twenty miles
distant. Evidently it had been a proud and happy occasion
for the little doctor, and it was with ill-concealed
gratification that he rattled off the list of those who had
likewise been at this illustrious shooting-party. In it
was one name very familiar to Evarne&mdash;Morris Kenyon.
She had never seen her father&#39;s early friend, but Leo often
dwelt lovingly upon his college life, and Morris Kenyon
had been, apparently, the central figure of those never-to-be-forgotten
days.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Crossways took his departure from &quot;The Retreat&quot;
in a state of high dudgeon. Accustomed as he was to being
called in to cope with every trivial ailment of the local
gentry, his professional pride was outraged by Mr. Stornway&#39;s
presuming to approach so very near to Death&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
portals without his steps having been carefully guided
down the path thereto by the controlling hand of a disciple
of Æsculapius. It was absolutely insulting&mdash;it really
bordered on Christian Science!</p>

<p class="indent">After parting from the irate doctor, Evarne returned
to her father&#39;s room. He raised his weary eyelids as she
entered, and looked at her with a troubled, almost remorseful,
expression. He had realised vaguely for some time
past that he was soon to seek the society of his dearly
beloved heroes of antiquity; but not until this solemn
medical visitation had he seriously considered the practical
earthly results of his soul winging its flight to the fields of
Asphodel.</p>

<p class="indent">When once he should be fairly off upon this interesting
journey, his young daughter would be left quite alone in
this world of sin and woe. What was to become of her?
He was singularly devoid of relations. A few distant
cousins and a poverty-stricken and decrepit uncle comprised
his entire stock in that line of goods, while he knew
nothing of his wife&#39;s common family beyond the fact that
she had a number of half-brothers and sisters somewhere
in Australia. He had but little money to leave his daughter,
and the girl had no training in any means of earning a
livelihood. He sighed despondently, as too late he recognised
this neglected duty.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne sat down by his side, and tenderly stroked his
hand. Ere long out came her little bit of interesting news&mdash;Mr.
Morris Kenyon was within twenty miles of Heatherington.</p>

<p class="indent">At the mention of this familiar name a sudden light
flashed into poor Leo&#39;s worried eyes. Surely for &quot;auld
lang syne&quot; this once dear friend would look after his
young daughter until she was able to support herself?
Morris was married to a charming wife&mdash;unfortunately
now a confirmed invalid. Leo had met the young lady at
the time of her wedding, and been favourably impressed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Surely she would feel for the desolate situation of the
young orphan. Filled with this idea, he bade Evarne
write, telling of her father&#39;s condition, and begging that
Morris would spare time to come over to visit him.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter was duly posted that night; the answer
arrived by return, the day after, Morris himself appeared
upon the scene. Leo wished to see his friend alone, so on
his arrival he was ushered by Mrs. Jarman direct to the
sick-room.</p>

<p class="indent">With engaging readiness Morris undertook to watch over
the welfare of the dying man&#39;s daughter when the time came,
and lightly brushed aside the broken thanks. But Leo&#39;s
gratitude was insistent and touching to witness. He
dwelt much upon the otherwise lonely situation of the
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is such a weight off my mind,&quot; he murmured again
and again. &quot;I never before realised how I have neglected
my duty to the child.&quot; And he sighed a deep breath of
relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, you must see her,&quot; he went on, as with a trembling
hand he rang a bell that stood by his side. In almost
immediate answer to the summons Evarne appeared in
the doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">Leo had made no mention of his daughter&#39;s striking
personal beauty. Dutiful, unselfish, intelligent&mdash;these,
and other eminently desirable mental and moral attributes
had he ascribed to her as recommendations in Morris&#39;s
eyes; but upon the subject of that physical quality that
counts for so much more than all the virtues under the sun,
the unworldly Leo had been silent. Kenyon had somehow
expected to see a stolid, robust, and, to him, altogether
uninteresting country damsel, and he with difficulty hid
his surprise on beholding the fair vision that answered
the summons.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne&#39;s manner was touched with timidity, but she was
not at all shy. She now stood silent and motionless for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
moment, surveying her father&#39;s friend with a grave and
interested gaze. Then, without waiting for any introduction,
she advanced towards him with outstretched hand
and a little smile of welcome upon her lips. Kenyon rose,
and as he clasped her hand and looked with the eye of a
connoisseur more closely into those charming features, he
was half-ashamed at the consciousness of a distinct sense
of satisfaction in the prospect of playing guardian angel
to such a singularly lovely creature.</p>

<p class="indent">He left &quot;The Retreat&quot; that evening feeling thoroughly
recompensed for the loss of his half-day&#39;s shooting, and
that just occasionally the fulfilling of the duties demanded
by friendship might bring their own reward.</p>

<p class="indent">Leo Stornway lingered for more weeks than either he or
the doctor had anticipated, but one morning, just at the
beginning of the New Year, he was found lying calm,
pallid, pulseless. His race was run. Silently and in loneliness
the end had come to a silent lonely life.</p>

<p class="indent">His desire had been to dispose of his earthly frame in
as classical a manner as possible. The notion he would
have really revelled in would have been a funeral pyre
on the common, with the villagers solemnly running races
and engaging in wrestling bouts in honour of his Manes,
in true Greek style. This being obviously out of the
question, he had set his heart upon the nearest thing
possible&mdash;ordinary cremation. This urgent desire was
found solemnly written on the back of a used envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">Hereupon arose trouble for Evarne. The local undertaker,
who respectfully yet promptly put in an appearance,
was aghast at her intention of arranging for the burning
of her father&#39;s body. He had no sympathy whatsoever
with innovations in his staid and respectable business.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the last thing you will ever be able to do for your
dear, dead parent, Miss Evarne,&quot; said the dour-looking
man. &quot;Give him a solid coffin&mdash;it needn&#39;t even be oak,
we have good lines in elm and ash&mdash;but <i>do</i> give him a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
decent coffin, and have him put under the earth like he
ought to be!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Jarman was of opinion that such a departure from
conventionality would be absolutely indecent. She also
waxed eloquent in another direction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I allus thought you loved your poor dead Pa. I could
&#39;ave sworn you wouldn&#39;t &#39;ave &#39;urt a &#39;air of his &#39;ead!&quot; she
repeated again and again, as if Evarne&#39;s resolve now
disposed of that supposition once and for all.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Crossways was so sure that had he only been consulted
in reasonable time neither cremation nor burial
would now be under discussion at all, that he declined to
offer the least suggestion of any sort. As to the vicar
and the curate, they called together on a visit of combined
sympathy and expostulation. Both seemed convinced that
a case of cremation must prove a serious inconvenience to
the Almighty on the Judgment Day&mdash;even if it did not
place Him in an absolute dilemma.</p>

<p class="indent">Into this general confusion and misery, Morris Kenyon&mdash;summoned
by Mrs. Jarman&mdash;descended with all the <i>eclat</i>
of the God in the Machine. He arrived at the very moment
when the two rival dressmakers of Heatherington, having
appeared simultaneously armed with yard measures and
black patterns, were quarrelling in stage whispers in the
porch.</p>

<p class="indent">This weighty matter settled, he proceeded to take all
the arrangements into his capable hands. Finally, he sat
down to a quiet conversation with the grateful Evarne,
the more beautiful for the pallor and distress, concerning
her future.</p>

<p class="indent">He learnt that her great ambition was to become an
artist. She possessed decided talent, combined with an
ardent appreciation of the beautiful, but she was absolutely
without training, and had evidently no idea of the long
years of steady labour&mdash;to say nothing of the &quot;filthy
lucre&quot;&mdash;that must be offered at the shrine of Art by would-be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
disciples. Looking at Morris, her big eyes filled with a
wistful anxiety, she inquired if the little money her father
had left could, by the strictest economy, be made to last
out until she was able to thus keep herself. If not&mdash;and
she had evidently come to this conference with her ideas
fully formed&mdash;could she not learn shorthand and typewriting?
Even then she hoped that, by rising early and
working at her painting after office hours and on Sundays,
she might ultimately earn her living by Art.</p>

<p class="indent">Kenyon smiled inwardly at the life she thus proposed for
herself. If he knew aught of the world, the sons of Adam
would see to it soon enough that this particular daughter
of Eve did not spend her days simply and solely divided
between banging the keys of a typewriter and daubing
sticky colours on a canvas. It was merely his luck that
he happened to be first in the field.</p>

<p class="indent">To Evarne he appeared kindliness itself. Certainly she
could and she should study Art; and this brought him
round to a suggestion that he hoped would give her pleasure.
He possessed a delightful villa in balmy Naples,
where Mrs. Kenyon was now staying to escape the rigours
of the English winter. Evarne must come out and stop
awhile with his wife. On the journey through Italy, she
should behold all its Art treasures. That alone, he assured
her, would form a splendid foundation for her later artistic
training.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite her sorrows, Evarne&#39;s face lit up with a sudden
brilliant light of happiness at this altogether delightful
prospect, both for the near and distant future. Her
brightened expression thanked her guardian more ardently
than did her softly-spoken words, and so it was settled.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chIII" id="chIII"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>A RICH CASKET FOR A RARE JEWEL</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Despite</span> the heavy heart with which Evarne
bade farewell to her home, the weeks occupied
by the protracted journey to Naples became a
period in which the light-heartedness of youth
gradually conquered sorrow. It was so crowded with
interest, novelty, fresh sights and experiences, that every
week seemed as a month, and her former monotonous
existence faded rapidly into the background. She seemed
a different being, living in a strange, new world. It was a
world in which Leo had never had a place, so that its
progress was in no ways affected by his absence. Evarne
mourned her father sincerely; shed many tears for him
in the silence of the night; and sometimes felt pangs of
compunction that novelty and interest should have such
powers of overcoming grief. But despite her reluctance
to accept their aid, these great forces continued their
healing work.</p>

<p class="indent">Amid its other charms and novelties, this new life was
one totally devoid of the necessity of considering ways and
means. The girl&#39;s natural tastes were far from simple,
and the luxury in which Morris lived and travelled soon
seemed not only congenial, but proper and customary.</p>

<p class="indent">At Paris, where they stayed some time, she first discovered
the subtle delight that lies in the possession of
dainty clothes. Her guardian gave her <i>carte blanche</i> at
both costumiers and milliners, but, through diffidence, she
took little advantage of this generosity. Realising this, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
visited one of the leading <i>ateliers</i>, and gave orders direct
to madame herself to lavishly stock Evarne&#39;s wardrobe.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus the girl found herself clad in garments totally
different to any she had ever seen&mdash;let alone possessed.
She reluctantly consented to try to endure corsets, but
very soon gave up the attempt in despair. But madame,
far from discouraged, exerted her ingenuity to array the
girl&#39;s lithe yet well-developed young form to the best
advantage without any such fictitious aid, and she succeeded
even beyond her expectations.</p>

<p class="indent">Never before had Evarne realised the latent possibilities
of her own figure. She took unconcealed delight in beholding
her reflection in the mirror, and positively revelled
in her silk linings, silk petticoats, silk stockings, and other
hitherto undreamed-of silken luxuries.</p>

<p class="indent">Venice was visited, then Ravenna, Florence, Pisa and
Rome. Day after day Morris was untiring in the thought
and care he took for his new toy. Evarne, apparently,
looked upon his utmost and constant attention as merely
part of the accepted routine of the journey, and noted it
with the quiet indifference of a spoilt beauty. Yet there
was no suggestion of coquetry or affectation about the
girl. Her mind, as well as her person, was developing on
calm, stately and dignified lines.</p>

<p class="indent">She was, in her turn, almost as quietly affectionate and
attentive to him as she would have been to her father,
but the vainest of men could not have persuaded himself
that she made the least effort&mdash;open or covert&mdash;to at all
unduly ingratiate herself into his regard. &quot;Kindness in
women, not their beauteous looks, shall win my love,&quot;
sings the wise poet, but Morris had been taught so early
and so often how many women are over-eager to be &quot;kind&quot;
to a wealthy man, that Evarne&#39;s simple ways were attractive
by reason of their very novelty. It served as a <i>sauce
piquante</i>, and before Naples was reached he felt more
genuine love for this sweet child than he had deemed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
well-worn article&mdash;his heart&mdash;would ever again have the
good luck to experience.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not until they were actually in the train bound
for Naples that he broke to her the information that the
looked-for introduction to Mrs. Kenyon must be postponed
for the present.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A letter from my wife reached me just before we left
Rome,&quot; he explained. &quot;She is very nervous, and fears
Vesuvius is working up for another eruption. She often
thinks that&mdash;pure fancy, of course! Anyway she has
gone on to Taormina, in Sicily. She will return to Naples
when she can muster courage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much she travels about,&quot; remarked the unsuspecting
Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doesn&#39;t she!&quot; agreed Morris with a grim little smile,
thinking of the invalid to whom the daily journey from
bedroom to boudoir was an arduous undertaking.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, noting a troubled expression on Evarne&#39;s face as
she gazed out of the window at the fast-flying landscape,
he asked, with a tiny hint of sadness in his voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I such dull company for a bright little girl that
you look thus solemn at the prospect of a few more <i>tête-à-tête</i>
meals?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took her hand as he spoke. Evarne had long ago
got to the point of finding it pleasant to feel her slender
fingers enclosed in his strong magnetic clasp. She smiled
a little and shook her head slightly in response to his question,
but the fingers he held moved restlessly, as if they
half-sought to free themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne&#39;s mental upbringing and education had been as
unusual and unconventional&mdash;to say the least of it&mdash;as
had been her physical training. She learnt the Greek
and English alphabets almost simultaneously, and while
other damsels of her years were skimming through
novelettes, she had been poring over the eternal and
inspiring works of the writers of antiquity. Which form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
of exclusive mental diet created, on the whole, the most
impracticable, the most false, the most mischievous ideas
when considered in reference to the stern realities of modern
life, it is difficult to say. Infinitely more than the average
girl of her age did Evarne know of the possible sins of
humanity, of the grim tragedies of history; infinitely less
of that perhaps more useful field of knowledge&mdash;the
restrictions, petty malignity, wickedness, and cruelly quick
suspicions of modern society.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, an instinct told her that there was a vast
difference between travelling under the escort of her
guardian to join his wife, and in staying with him at his
villa without that lady.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you not think Mrs. Kenyon expects us to go on to
her at Sicily?&quot; she suggested in a hesitating voice, divided
between her fear of appearing to presume and dictate,
and her instinctive shrinking from this new programme.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris read the trouble in the girl&#39;s mind, and promptly
answered in the one and only manner that was calculated
to set her thoroughly at ease again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you are comfortably fixed up at Naples I will
go on to Taormina and bring back the truant. As to you,
my dear, forgive my plain speaking, but it is time you
seriously started to study for your future profession. There
are excellent Art masters at Naples, and you can draw in
the museum there, but in Sicily there is nothing of all this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he had foreseen, this business-like view of the proceeding
reconciled her to it as nothing else would have
done, and it was with a light heart and a smiling face that
she first set foot over the threshold of &quot;Mon Bijou.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris himself conducted his little guest to the rooms
that had been prepared for her occupation. The villa
was situated on the heights overlooking the bay, and
Evarne, stepping out on to the verandah, stood enthralled
by the beauty around. She gazed over the broad expanse
of purple sea sparsely dotted with small sails, white and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
brown&mdash;at the island of Capri, haunted by the memory of
dark mysteries&mdash;at the far distant dome of the Italian
heavens that crowned all. Then she let her delighted eyes
wander over the picturesque roof-tops of the town to the
soft yet never-failing canopy of smoke that mingled itself
with billowy white clouds overshadowing the crater of
Vesuvius the volcano.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she looked at the gardens of the villa itself. There
she saw paths made of smooth-coloured pebbles arranged
in mosaic designs, winding amid strange and luxurious
trees and shrubs and blossoms; saw snowy statues gleaming
amid the green growth; saw arbours, set near the
scent of orange-blossom or mimosa; while a white marble
fountain&mdash;an art treasure in itself&mdash;gaily tossed upwards
a sparkling jet of water, which fell with a gentle splash
into a deep, carved basin encircled by thick clumps of
flowers.</p>

<p class="indent">Overwhelmed by beauty so universal, so lavish, so
abundant, she stood rapt until Morris&#39;s patience was
exhausted. When at length she could be persuaded to
pay attention to her apartments she found them, in their
way, to be equally enchanting&mdash;equally appealing.</p>

<p class="indent">The chief room was very large, and decorated with an
almost florid luxuriance. Everywhere the eye turned
were pictures, statuettes, carved ivories, bowls and vases
and bronzes&mdash;each the embodiment of some artistic dream.
Everything was profuse&mdash;there were many books, many
mirrors, much gilding, carving, tapestry and embroidery,
while masses of vivid flowers scented the air.</p>

<p class="indent">The characteristic feature, however, was the mad riot
and mingling of every glaring hue, blended together into a
bewildering yet exquisite harmony. There was mauve and
deepest violet, gold, blue, and a touch of emerald green.
The walls were rich crimson, with creamy white introduced
into the deep frieze, whereon dancing maidens were moulded
in relief. The whole scheme of colour was daring, brilliant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
defiant; it suggested life, youth, vitality, pleasure without
remorse.</p>

<p class="indent">The little bedroom opened out from this. It was daintily
small, all white and pale green, the one striking splash of
colour being given by a bowl of pink roses. Simple, demure,
unassuming, it formed a strange contrast to the
tropical violence of its neighbour.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as Evarne was quite alone she placed herself in
the centre of the brilliant red room, and pivoting round
slowly, surveyed every wall&mdash;every corner&mdash;anew. It
was scarcely three months since she had left the austerity
of &quot;The Retreat&quot;&mdash;three months in which she had learnt,
seen, done and heard more than in all the previous years
of her life. In the dazzling luxury of this room the culminating
point of the extraordinary difference between the
past and the present seemed to be attained. Its mad
superabundance of wealth and colour, appealing so forcefully
to the emotions, bewildered the child. Everything
about it appeared indefinably wrong&mdash;almost unnatural&mdash;and
for a moment the instinctive fear of the unknown
gripped her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she became apprehensive, afraid of life, of the
hidden future and what it held. She felt very young,
very ignorant, very helpless&mdash;a stranger not only in a far
land, but in a strange world. If only Mrs. Kenyon had
been here to welcome her! Apparently no one about the
place could speak a word of English save Morris himself&mdash;and,
of course, his valet. Even with the bright little maid
who was to attend on her, she had found she could only
converse by signs. She walked timidly over the thick,
yielding carpet and leant against the open window, breathing
deeply of the fresh, pure air. But a little while and
her natural courage rallied, the shadow of depression was
tossed aside; she turned back into the room, glanced
round it once again with sparkling eyes lit up by admiration,
and all unconsciously broke into a snatch of joyous song.</p>

<h2><a name="chIV" id="chIV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>THE WAY OF A MAN WITH A MAID</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">No</span> trace of the uneasiness of the afternoon remained,
as Evarne&mdash;clad in a Parisian triumph,
a loosely-falling dinner-gown of fragile black
chiffon and lace&mdash;took her seat that evening opposite
Morris in the cosy little anteroom in which he had
ordered meals to be served in preference to the ordinary
dining-room. She was bright and smiling and appreciative,
as throughout that first evening beneath his own roof he
exerted himself particularly to please and entertain her.</p>

<p class="indent">Not that this called for much additional effort. Evarne
invariably found her guardian&#39;s society to be more inspiring
and exhilarating than his own champagne. Even
in his ordinary converse with this unusual young girl, the
whole of his knowledge of men and matters, his wide experience,
his original ideas, all his natural wit and brightness
ever flowed forth readily and unrestricted. True, this
implied not only the teachings of some doctrines more or
less heretical, but a certain element of looseness of speech
and the recounting of anecdotes and incidents not usually
deemed appropriate to the ears of sweet seventeen.</p>

<p class="indent">So, albeit the previous delicacy of her every thought
unavoidably gave place to something less ethereal, her
character developed and matured by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Reading maketh a full man, conversation a ready man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl&#39;s nature&mdash;rendered, perhaps, somewhat over-serious
by solitude and much deep reading&mdash;only needed
the mental stimulant of a brilliant and clever man&#39;s society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
to grow rapidly bright and alert. She learnt to find interest
in many a subject hitherto sealed. From dress to politics&mdash;from
hard facts to vague fancies&mdash;from logical deducing to
limitless speculating, her mind was daily led over fresh
fields and pastures new, and rejoiced in this wandering.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris and Evarne sat up later that night than they had
ever yet done together. Within these walls Morris alone
held sway, and both felt the subtle influence of this state
of affairs, so opposed to the constant, comparative surveillance
of life in hotels. At length the musical notes of
the clock chimed the hour past midnight, and Evarne
sprang from her low chair, startled by the flight of
time.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris went upstairs with her. Standing on the threshold
of her room she touched the knob of the electric
burners, then held out both hands with her usual frankness
to bid him good-night.</p>

<p class="indent">He held them for a few seconds with that firm and
affectionate clasp in which she so delighted. But then,
suddenly transferring both her hands into one of his, he
put the first two fingers of his free hand to his own lips
and immediately pressed them gently upon Evarne&#39;s rosy
mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">It was at most a mere suggestion of a kiss, yet with a
startled glance she jerked her hands away, stepped back
quickly, instinctively slamming the door, and Morris,
standing outside with a little grimace of amusement on
his countenance, heard the key turn in the lock.</p>

<p class="indent">It was apparently a decided rebuke, yet he went downstairs
well pleased by the very violence of her reception of
this experimental advance. Easily enough had he conquered
any temptation to kiss the girl as long as there
remained the fear that she might accept his kisses dutifully,
as mere fatherly salutes. But the light that had darted
into her eloquent eyes at the simple pressure of his fingers
upon those fresh, unsullied lips of hers, satisfied him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
such an idea&mdash;had it ever existed&mdash;had been got rid of forever.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne flung herself amid the purple cushions of a big
chair and shut her eyes. Ere long one idea evolved itself
from the tangle of confused thought, and placed itself&mdash;clearly
and shamelessly&mdash;before the bar of her reason, to be
relentlessly judged. Did she indeed owe all that Mr.
Kenyon was doing for her&mdash;was giving her&mdash;simply to the
fact that she was Leo Stornway&#39;s daughter, or were her
own youth&mdash;her beauty&mdash;her sex&mdash;the real forces that
prompted his generous actions?</p>

<p class="indent">Scarcely one second for calm deliberation was granted
her. The very process of actually formulating such a
question, brought into conscious existence a knowledge
that was both crushing and exalting&mdash;terrifying and delightful.
Doubtless it had been forming itself in her heart and
brain for many a long day, but its appearance as a fully-fledged
fact&mdash;something that had to be acknowledged and
reckoned with&mdash;came with the dazzling sharpness of lightning
athwart a summer sky.</p>

<p class="indent">Whatever might be the nature of her guardian&#39;s feelings,
this one fact she knew all too well. Come what might <i>she</i>
loved <i>him</i>&mdash;loved him devotedly&mdash;passionately&mdash;with all
the ardour of youth and a nature formed for loving. She
realised that if in his eyes she was not the fairest amid
women, she might as well be possessed of no beauty; if
he did not seek and enjoy her society before that of any
other creature alive, she was worthless in her own sight;
if all this divine emotion that had come to her could touch
no answering chord within his breast, life would be as a
weed, worthless, without colour, perfume or sweetness.</p>

<p class="indent">To realise so much during a single tick of the clock was
overwhelming! Instinctively concealing her face in the
cushions Evarne found her breathing oppressed, while as
to her heart&mdash;it stood quite still for one brief moment,
apparently daunted by the magnitude of the additional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
task suddenly imposed upon it. Then loyally rising to
the occasion, it continued to beat, but with altogether
unusual violence and rapidity, as wishing defiantly to show
that it could bear up with a good grace even under this
double duty.</p>

<p class="indent">Ere long Evarne sat erect again, while then and there
her soul soared aloft into vaporous and shining realms of
happiness. Yet no white angel would have veiled its face
before this sweet maiden&#39;s thoughts and ideals in her first
love. Not for some time did she so much as remember
that Morris was married, and even then she was in no mood
to actively regret Mrs. Kenyon&#39;s existence.</p>

<p class="indent">That lady&#39;s rights were so unquestioned; Evarne would
have shrunk with horror at the mere notion that she should
ever come to resent the wife as either a rival or a hindrance.</p>

<p class="indent">The fact that she believed Morris was a kind, affectionate
and faithful husband, was quite consistent with his returning
her love&mdash;at all events, love as she conceived it and
desired it in return. Notwithstanding her classical reading,
the girl failed to realise that her passion&mdash;youthful, virginal
and absolutely spiritual, yet ardent and enthralling&mdash;was
an emotion absolutely unknown to any male mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Long she sat, enchanted by the fair landscapes of this
unexplored country across whose borders her feet had
newly strayed. When at length she nestled down into her
soft, scented bed, still the same soft visions gladdened her
mind.</p>

<p class="indent">Next morning, after finishing her coffee and roll, she lay
back lazily and reflected with the clearer, more rational,
thoughts of the early hours of the day, upon the one topic
that now appeared of paramount importance.</p>

<p class="indent">After a while Bianca, her little maid, entered, and with
painstaking effort repeated in English a short message
that she had evidently just learnt. &quot;Master wishes come
pay his respects to signorina.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne renounced day-dreams and meditations and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
arose immediately. Blissfully independent of hair-curlers
or any other such artificial accessories, her toilette could
be completed with marvellous rapidity. Now, in considerably
less than half an hour, she issued from her room
fresh and blooming as a spring flower, and all unconsciously
greeted Morris with the richest smile she had
ever flashed upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked bright and <i>debonnairé</i> that morning, and it
was difficult to realise that he was in fact the contemporary
of the girl&#39;s father. He seemed so glad to behold her
again after the few hours&#39; separation, asked with such
evident interest and concern if she had slept well, held her
hand for so long and finished by pressing it so warmly
between his own, that Evarne blushed slightly for very
happiness, as with unerring instinct her heart answered
its own question, &quot;He does care&mdash;he does&mdash;he does!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In her previous notions concerning both men and women
who had attained to the mature and dignified age of five-and-forty,
she had unconsciously taken it for granted that
Cupid always observed a due respect for such elderly hearts.
True, she was well-informed respecting poor Hera&#39;s troubles.
Zeus had surely been old&mdash;quite old and grey-bearded&mdash;yet
apparently he could not ever look down from high
Olympus, even on business, without his eye falling on
some fair damsel who promptly became entitled to a place
amid the crowd of rival fair ones who packed that miraculously
capacious heart. Nevertheless, despite this seemingly
instructive knowledge, it was only as she grew to
know Morris that her ideas became revolutionised on the
subject of middle-aged men who were not divinities, but
merely modern and mortal. Now, her guardian&#39;s years,
viewed with the eyes of affection, appeared simply as an
additional fascination.</p>

<p class="indent">After a while he proceeded to consult her regarding their
plans for the day. Would she like to go sight-seeing that
morning, or rest after the fatigues of yesterday&#39;s journey?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
Evarne was still amused at this novel notion, evidently
entertained by Morris, that she was a fragile blossom
requiring to be carefully tended and cherished. The idea
flashed across her: &quot;How different life will be in a year or
two when I am all alone in cheap little rooms in London,
earning a precarious living by Art.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This led her to recall what her guardian had told her
last night concerning the two most celebrated Art masters
in Naples.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are very different one from another, both in
their style of work and their method of teaching,&quot; he had
said. &quot;I will take you to visit both studios, and you can
see if one appeals to you more than the other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now she reminded him of this promise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to oversee the unpacking of my boxes,&quot; she
said, &quot;and then, if you please, I should like to visit the
studios you spoke of. I want to start working in all
seriousness almost at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no hurry; postpone that!&quot; was the lazy advice.
But she shook her head with righteous emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t mean to delay and delay like the foolish virgins
in the Bible. You remember that story?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t say I remember those particular damsels,&quot;
rejoined Morris, with a twinkle in his eye; &quot;but candidly
I maintain that <i>all</i> virgins are foolish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a very debatable point!&quot; retorted Evarne,
smiling, yet slightly biting her under-lip. &quot;Seriously, I
want to start work at once. Now, let me go and put on
my hat, and we will place business before pleasure, like
good people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This time Morris wisely checked the response that rose
to his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">The rival studios both got visited that day, and the
one wherein Evarne was to experience the pangs and
delights of the aspiring Art student was duly settled upon.
It was really somewhat absurd that a mere beginner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
totally untrained in the very rudiments of drawing, should
be introduced into such an advanced coterie as that of
Florelli&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">As Evarne gazed with admiring yet somewhat saddened
eyes at the work of the other students, she felt this herself.
To her they all seemed finished artists already! She could
certainly get herself up in a loose overall plentifully besmeared
with paint and charcoal, she could allow a curl
of hair to escape from its confining bonds, and thus&mdash;as far
as appearance went&mdash;be on an artistic equality with those
of her new companions who were of the feminine persuasion.
But would she ever be able to work as beautifully as did
these young men and women? She doubted it, and yet,
appalling realisation! these superior young people were not
winning fame and fortune. Alack and alas, they were still
studying&mdash;still knew their work imperfect&mdash;were still
striving to attain!</p>

<p class="indent">The momentary wave of despair was followed by a
somewhat frantic impatience to make an immediate start
along this far-stretching road that lay before her. She
wanted to return at once to &quot;Mon Bijou,&quot; to set up a pot
or vase and endeavour to make a drawing of it in which
the two sides should at least decently resemble one another.
It was all very nice and amusing to sketch pretty little
faces with huge eyes, tiny mouths and masses of very curly
hair; to cover sheets of notepaper with angels whose big,
feathery wings and vapoury bodies conveniently vanished
into nothing. But one day in Paris she had tried to make
a correct drawing of a dull, unimaginative vase, and her
effort had been brought to an abrupt and highly unsatisfactory
conclusion by the much-employed indiarubber
working a hole in the paper.</p>

<p class="indent">That evening, as she and Morris walked in the garden
star-gazing, she honestly confided to him her fear that the
attaining of artistic excellence would be a longer task than
she had at all realised. He did not appear to sink under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
the shock, but, on the contrary, inquired calmly enough
&quot;what that mattered.&quot; Hesitatingly, Evarne broached
the subject of expense. It was a matter that pressed rather
heavily upon her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">His answer was unexpected. Half opening his lips as
if to speak, he closed them again firmly, looked frowningly
into her tremulous, upturned countenance, then suddenly
slipping his arm round her waist, drew her closely to him.
Her instantaneous impulse was to free herself&mdash;not because
she wanted to, far from it&mdash;but because she knew well
enough that such were dull duty&#39;s dictates. Still, she
hesitated a moment, and thereby lost the strength of
mind necessary to maintain strict propriety upon its lofty
pedestal. On the contrary, she rested quite impassive, and
Morris felt her soft uncorseted waist heave slightly with
the deep, quivering breath she drew. Somewhat fiercely
clasping her yet closer, in a second his other arm was also
around her, and he was straining the flexible young form
to his breast with all the abandon of a man who, having
reluctantly practised self-control for long, lets himself go
at last.</p>

<p class="indent">But his very ardour and heedless violence frightened
Evarne immediately. Using the whole of her considerable
strength she endeavoured to break away from his clasp.
&quot;Don&#39;t, don&#39;t!&quot; she cried in unmistakable earnestness,
and besides genuine alarm there was a touch of decided
anger in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as she had freed herself she stood irresolute&mdash;motionless
and fascinated&mdash;yet obviously prepared at any
second to dart away. Indeed, unconsciously, prompted
by her athletic instincts, she rested, poised with her heels
already slightly raised off the earth.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked more Greek than ever at that moment;
fitted indeed to form part of some legend&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Of deities or mortals, or of both;</span><br />
<span class="i0">In Temple, or the dales of Arcady.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
Morris gazing at her with eager, ardent appreciation, yet
read a warning that he must venture no farther that night!
Trusting and confiding though Evarne might be, she was
too serious, too thoughtful, to accept such overtures with
childish carelessness.</p>

<p class="indent">Her expression gradually clouded, for the unknown
Mrs. Kenyon rose in indignant might before her mind&#39;s eye!
Morris, guessing the nature of some of her thoughts, knew
that in dealing with a young woman possessed of such
painfully lofty principles, discretion was indeed the better
part of valour. Moreover, he was far too genuinely attached
to her to wish to cause her undue distress, and,
however strong she might be physically, he knew well
that where her feelings were concerned, Evarne was in
deed a &quot;fragile flower,&quot; to be guarded well and treated
tenderly.</p>

<p class="indent">So he just smiled calmly and reassuringly, and into his
eyes came that kindly, indulgent look that always stirred
the girl&#39;s very heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, pretty one,&quot; he said, &quot;hold my hand quietly,
and go on telling me the troubles about the drawing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Such a sudden change of manner and topic was quite
bewildering; Evarne could not accommodate herself to
it all with equal rapidity. There was a considerable pause,
while he stood waiting with his hand outstretched. The
imprint of very varying emotions passed over the girl&#39;s
gentle countenance. By the brilliant light of the moon
every fleeting expression could be seen, and the look with
which she at length laid her hand in his could not have been
displeasing even to the chaste goddess whose clear rays
rendered it visible.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhat hastily Evarne proceeded to chatter about the
studio, but her nerves were overwrought, and her voice
sounded strange to her own ears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us go in,&quot; she urged ere long; &quot;I&#39;m cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cold now, perhaps,&quot; murmured Morris softly, &quot;but, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
I mistake not, magnificently capable of burning with the
most divine of all fires.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made no answer. He could not be sure that she had
heard, or if she had, that she understood. Neither was he
at all sure that the time had even yet come when it was
really desirable that she should hear and understand.</p>

<h2><a name="chV" id="chV"></a>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>THE WILES OF THE FOWLER</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Within</span> a week of taking up her residence at
&quot;Mon Bijou,&quot; Evarne started her career at
Florelli&#39;s. She proved very painstaking, and
earnest&mdash;so much so as to cause considerable
surprise to the other students, who had judged, from the
luxury of her attire and appointments, that she was a mere
<i>dilettante</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">She was far and away the most elementary pupil in the
studio, and truth to tell did not find it particularly interesting
to sit alone hour after hour in a corner, covering reams
of Michallet, and using up boxes of charcoal in repeated
struggles to depict gigantic plaster replicas of detached
features from Michael Angelo&#39;s &quot;David,&quot; or innumerable
casts of torsos, of arms and legs, hands and feet, in all
sizes and attitudes&mdash;painfully suggestive of amputations.</p>

<p class="indent">For stimulus and encouragement she would peep into
the two rooms where the more advanced students were
working from life, in one room from the costume model, in
the other from the nude. The mental atmosphere of these
rooms was so full of energy and enthusiasm that she would
return with fresh ardour to her limbs and features.</p>

<p class="indent">Not that she was able to devote all her time to the services
of the exigent Muses, nor, alas! could this pursuit
arouse the keenest, most engrossing thoughts and energies
of which her nature was capable. Interest in this, as in
everything else in the wide universe, showed pallid and
feeble before the overwhelming and concentrated interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
of her love for Morris Kenyon. There was something
almost tragic in such a domination. Barely seventeen,
her heart and mind should have been still too youthful, too
immature, to conceive and sustain such force of emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris had many friends in Naples, and both visited and
entertained considerably. Evarne, both by reason of her
studies and her recent loss, could be prevailed upon to
take very little part in any fêtes. Still, she started to
learn Italian, and was soon able to express her will to
Bianca in all simple matters, and to amuse Morris by her
courageous, laughable efforts.</p>

<p class="indent">She fancied herself a perfect little diplomatist, and was
blissfully unaware that her affection for him was very
soon betrayed to his experienced eye by her every look&mdash;every
word&mdash;every action. Under the circumstances,
silence on the momentous topic so uppermost in both minds
was naturally not maintained for long.</p>

<p class="indent">One night as she sat on a footstool at his feet, spoiling
her eyesight by delicate fancy work, not speaking much, but
at intervals contentedly humming a little song, a sudden
impatience at further waste of time took possession of him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evarne,&quot; he said abruptly, and as the girl in all unconsciousness
stayed her needle and looked up inquiringly, he
bent forward, and without any warning pressed his lips
to hers. Then, shaken from his habitual calm, he placed
his hands heavily upon her shoulders and gazed intently
into her eyes, his expression telling yet more than his
actions.</p>

<p class="indent">She remained motionless as if hypnotised, her face still
uplifted. &quot;Evarne, sweetest little Evarne!&quot; he murmured
after a pause, in accents tender and caressing. At
the sound of his voice she dropped her head slowly lower
and yet lower, until it finally rested upon his knee. Still
she spoke nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">Slipping his arms around her, he forcibly drew her up
until her head was pillowed upon his breast. Then he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
kissed her again and again, kissed her brow, her hair, her
cheeks, her mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darling, are you happy?&quot; he breathed at length into
her ear.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon this the girl released herself from his hold, and
kneeling erect by his side, looked with wide-open, excited,
somewhat horrified eyes straight into his. It was no
highly-wrought sentiment either of love or indignation
that fell from her lips. Simply, yet emphatically, she
cried&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, we mustn&#39;t! we mustn&#39;t! We were both forgetting
your wife!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris was rather proud of his versatility, and cultivated
the art of being all things to all women. The last lady
on whom he had temporarily bestowed his affections had,
like Evarne, been tactless and inconsiderate enough to
invoke the memory of the happily absent one at a critical
moment. To Evarne&#39;s predecessor he had lightly remarked,
&quot;Oh! hang my wife, Birdie. She doesn&#39;t count.&quot;
Birdie had giggled, called him a &quot;naughty man,&quot; and there
had been an end to that topic.</p>

<p class="indent">To have addressed any such flippant answer to Evarne
and her clamouring conscience would have meant the end
of all things. Morris unhesitatingly took the one and only
course that would serve his turn now. He adopted the
plan of apparent perfect frankness, not only regarding
the legal partner of his joys and woes, but concerning much
else that he had hitherto kept hidden.</p>

<p class="indent">With many a sign of great mental struggle, now flashing
forth eloquent glances, now veiling his eyes from her clear,
searching gaze, he made confession of his deception concerning
Mrs. Kenyon&#39;s promised presence at &quot;Mon Bijou.&quot;
He waxed alternately ardent and pathetic as he discoursed
upon the love he bore Evarne and all that it meant to him,
vowing that it was the intensity of his affection alone
that had prompted him to his falsehood. He abused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
himself so unsparingly, that half-unconsciously she was
moved to utter a pleading little cry of pity and expostulation.</p>

<p class="indent">Thereupon he went on to explain in touching terms that
he was but a lonely, desolate man, rapidly becoming weary
of life, embittered and miserable, until her charm, her sweet
goodness, aroused him, awoke affection and brought fresh
zest into his existence&mdash;and so on, and so on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My wife, well, she was a nicely-brought-up, rather silly
girl, pretty enough once and good-natured too, but now
soured and aged by permanent, incurable illness. There is
no bond of any kind between us. We have not a thought
in common. There are no children; she can never be
either companion or wife to me. Frail though she is, she
has a marvellous vitality, a wondrous clinging to life.
Such unhappy existences&mdash;a curse to themselves and others,&mdash;are
always prolonged. Think of it, dearest, think what
it means to a man to be practically tied to a corpse, cut off
from all the joy of living.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he soared to lofty heights of moralising, told her&mdash;or
at least implied&mdash;that all his hopes of heaven rested
upon her gentle influence and affection. &quot;I may seem
to others but a hard, somewhat cynical man of the world,
yet I have got here&quot;&mdash;and in true dramatic style he struck
his breast over the supposed region of a presumably panting
heart&mdash;&quot;I have got here a longing for a true woman&#39;s disinterested,
faithful affection, such as many a sentimental
stringer together of rhymes has never experienced. Evarne,
care for me a little; love me, darling. Let me love you.
It means everything to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All this sentiment quite overcame his sweet-natured
listener. Morris had made a studied though carefully
veiled appeal, either by his looks or his words, direct to her
most generous instincts. If much of it was mere acting&mdash;exaggerated
and artificial&mdash;his passionate desire to gain
her love was real enough. It was no reproach to frank,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
unsuspicious, inexperienced Evarne&mdash;already blinded by
affection&mdash;that she could see only the evident sincerity that
inspired all this bombast.</p>

<p class="indent">A flood of tender pity and sympathy swelled in her
breast; all resentment at his deception, all hesitation and
restraint, were swept away. If the assurance of her deep
love, her utter trust, did in very truth mean happiness to
him, it should be his. Rising to her feet impulsively, she
pressed his head with almost fierce force against her bosom,
murmuring, &quot;I do love you, my dear one. Indeed, I do
love you.&quot; Then she bent over, and almost reverently
pressed a long kiss upon his brow.</p>

<p class="indent">So far, so good, and in mutual love confessed Evarne&#39;s
ideal was attained! It was rather incomprehensible that
she could for one minute have supposed that &quot;finis&quot;
would be written in Morris&#39;s masculine conception of the
old, old story, at a similar point to where it appeared in
the poetical version that had been evolved from out her
imagination. Yet when, in the course of a very short time,
the inevitable discovery was made that he had never entertained
the notion of loving her as an &quot;inspiration to a
noble life,&quot; nor as a &quot;kindred soul,&quot; nor as his &quot;good
angel,&quot; but merely as a man always loves a woman, and
that he sought a return of affection in kind, it came as a
stunning revelation.</p>

<p class="indent">At first Morris had not been at all sure but that she
would endeavour to shake the dust of &quot;Mon Bijou&quot; from
her feet without delay. In fact, he always declared
that, probably inspired by the vicinity of Capri, she had
given him to understand that he was on a moral level with
the defunct Tiberius. But for her own part her first
recollections that were at all clear and distinct were very
different.</p>

<p class="indent">In all moments of mental disturbance her first desire
was for solitude, and in this crisis, bidding Morris not to
follow her, she sped wildly out into the dark garden.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
There, leaning for support against the pillar of a statue,
and gazing up at the serene masses of white clouds and the
tinted halo encircling the moon, breathing in the perfume
of the earth and its green growth, while a gentle breath of
sea-breezes played with her heavy hair, she gradually
regained calmness.</p>

<p class="indent">Her Greek studies had taught her much&mdash;so much that
she had believed there was but little left for her to learn.
Yet to us all is life an untold tale&mdash;strange, unique, unguessed.
What wisdom of sage, what sensual raptures of
pagan poet, had ever prompted her to anticipate the
exaltation, the triumph, that awoke at the realisation that
she too had her share in the resistless power of womanhood?
She felt plunged into full harmony with nature&mdash;felt herself
knit to the great heart of woman all the world over by the
sentient cords of sex-sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent">Carried out of herself she flung back her head and gave
utterance to emotion by lifting up her voice in song&mdash;just
full rich notes that rolled forth unconsidered, all
unhampered by words&mdash;a spontaneous outpouring of glorification
and the joy of victory. Pressing both hands
hard upon her bosom she felt the force with which it
rose and fell beneath her deep breathing, and strangely
delighted, the girl laughed triumphantly with the notes
of her song.</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden step near by startled her into abrupt shamefaced
silence: Morris stood by her side. He had been
seeking her in the garden and had traced her by this wild
song that broke the stillness of the night. Unrestricted
displays of feeling were entirely new to Evarne, her previous
uneventful routine having given scant cause for much
excitement of any sort. Now she felt keen abashment at
her extraordinary show of emotion, and was almost humiliated
to realise that she was not alone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you not to follow me. I don&#39;t want you,&quot; she
said quickly and decidedly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
For a moment Morris was startled; then he understood
the change that was beginning to take place in her mind.
No longer was she a simple child addressing her guardian
and benefactor, but a woman growing conscious of her own
power. Of course she would be whimsical, capricious,
alternately authoritative and submissive, wilful and yielding,
like the rest of the darlings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I meant to obey,&quot; he answered with ready meekness,
&quot;but can you blame the impotence of mortal man&#39;s
resolution when the siren calls?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sudden anger flashed over Evarne at this vague suggestion
that she had fled from him only to draw him to her
side again by her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not a siren, and I don&#39;t say one thing and mean
another, though I know you find it difficult to believe that
of any woman,&quot; she replied curtly, and with head erect
walked back through the French window into the brightly-lit
room. Once safely out of sight, she darted rapidly
upstairs to the safety of her own room.</p>

<p class="indent">In a minute or two she heard her name called softly
through the door, then the pleading whisper&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evarne, I can have no rest unless I know you are not
angry with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was silent for a moment, but the delay was brief.
No resentment could endure before the music of that dear
voice. She guessed right well that a locked door between
them was all-sufficient for Morris to endure, so answered
him generously, as her heart prompted&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rest, then; rest happily now and ever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Within the peaceful sanctuary of her delicate green and
white bedroom, the chief amid her more normal thoughts
and feelings resumed their sway. Foremost came that
imperative demand for self-approbation&mdash;that pride in
self&mdash;that made her ever the slave of what she held to be
honourable. The spirit of righteousness sprang up alert,
quick to wage war against the mere suggestion that under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
any provocation&mdash;any excuse of overwhelming stress of
love&mdash;she should permit herself to be stained by dishonour.</p>

<p class="indent">Strong and self-confident, the girl at last sank to sleep.
But her slumber was light, and early next morning she was
awake and thoughtful. She acknowledged being glad to
have experienced the sensations of last night&mdash;glad to have
been granted that period of exaltation, and to have revelled
in it to the full. It had made all life seem more understandable
and interesting&mdash;yet it had brought about no
wondrous change of personality! Evarne still remained
herself; still good and conscientious and new to the ways
of love; a young philosopher, and therefore indulgent to
the natural frailties of mankind. She esteemed Morris
not one whit the less for having shown himself but human;
yet&mdash;realising that he could not make her his wife&mdash;her
conscience and her wishes united in the resolution that
love &#39;twixt him and herself must ever remain a thing
ethereal&mdash;a poem&mdash;a fair dream&mdash;a sweet sentiment
blossoming only in the soul.</p>

<p class="indent">She went to Florelli&#39;s as usual, but her studies occupied
a very secondary place in her thoughts. All she meant to
say to Morris&mdash;all he might perhaps answer&mdash;all the
beautiful sentiments she had to express and which she was
sure must appeal so irresistibly to him&mdash;all the lofty ideals
of her soul that she was going to impart to his&mdash;obtruded
themselves between her mind and her drawing.</p>

<p class="indent">As she dressed for dinner that evening an unexpected
shyness crept over her, and it was with quite an effort that
she went downstairs. But all imagined difficulties and
embarrassments faded like snow before the sunlight of his
eyes. Her own danced for joy at being in his presence
again, yet there was a touch of stiffness and formality in
her demeanour that was new.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris listened more or less patiently to her dear little
sermons, and with difficulty resisted stopping her pretty
lips with kisses. But she was very much on her dignity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
that night, so assuring her that she was nothing more
than a sweet, refreshing baby, he merely delivered a
sermon on his own account, with a very different text.</p>

<p class="indent">That night the influence of the day&#39;s high meditation
rendered her proof against his sophistries, but as time
passed their steady reiteration began to make headway.
Morris unswervingly bent all his powers to gain control
of the situation. The sport amused him. He had nothing
to distract his attention, and the prize was so well worth
the winning that time and trouble were as nothing. He
attempted no sudden decisive <i>coup</i>, feeling greater confidence
in the weapons of gentle argument and persuasion,
patience and a discreet mingling of ardour and forbearance.</p>

<h2><a name="chVI" id="chVI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>A SOUL&#39;S BATTLE</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Evarne</span> grew steadily more troubled&mdash;more unhappy&mdash;more
shaken in her once firm convictions.
Up to the present, save in a few unconsidered
trifles, she had always obeyed the dictates of her
conscience. Now this prop failed her; indeed, she seemed
to have two opposing consciences, each struggling for
supremacy.</p>

<p class="indent">While one inward voice would desperately recall the
existence of Mrs. Kenyon, the other would reply by scornfully
declaring that it was but selfishness, cowardice,
calculating prudence and cold lack of trust, that clutched
hold of the vision of the distant invalid whose finger bore
the only wedding ring that Morris could give, and that
these contemptible qualities used the wife but as a moral
shield behind which to conceal their own mean, hideous
forms. There was no breaking up of a previously happy
home involved, no ruthless destroying of another woman&#39;s
peace of mind; while beyond a doubt she was depriving
the man she professed to love&mdash;and to whom she owed
everything&mdash;of the only return she could make for all his
kindness and devoted affection.</p>

<p class="indent">Obviously this spiritual civil war could not forever
consist of drawn battles between the rival forces. Ere
long even her own self-respect&mdash;the chief bulwark of the
defending army&mdash;trembling beneath resistless attacks,
was on the verge of capitulation. True, she might have
fled from &quot;Mon Bijou,&quot; but convinced of Morris&#39;s engrossing
love, she could not do this without likening herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
to the snake of the fable, who, warmed back to life in its
rescuer&#39;s bosom, then turned and stung him.</p>

<p class="indent">But unless she thus left Morris desolate, and cast herself
helpless and penniless upon the world, she was forced to
continue to accept everything&mdash;mere food and raiment,
let alone luxury&mdash;at his hands, and above all to receive
daily and hourly that care and devotion that can only be
repaid in coin of the same nature. He so obviously delighted
in giving; was she, for her part, empty of all
sense of gratitude, of all generosity?</p>

<p class="indent">Almost she began to deem herself something to be
despised, and self-reproaches bordering upon remorse
caused the bread of charity to taste bitter in her mouth.
At times every sentiment that is most ennobling seemed
ranged amongst the forces that bade her let love pay its
debt. This veering of the tide of battle was not very visible,
even to the man&#39;s watchful and experienced eye. His
patience was getting exhausted. He had been fully prepared
to wait, but with the passing of time, the light in
which Warren Hastings regarded the questionable acquirement
of his much-discussed Indian fortune became applicable
to Morris Kenyon&#39;s state of mind concerning his
dealings with Evarne. He began to feel &quot;surprised at
his own moderation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore, on coming up quietly behind her one afternoon
as she sat sketching in the garden, he overheard
with some satisfaction the words she was softly singing as
she worked. It was the beginning of Emerson&#39;s little poem&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&quot;Give all to love;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Obey thy heart;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Friends, kindred, days,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Estate, good-fame,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Plans, credit, and the Muse,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Nothing refuse.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">When a fair maiden beguiles her solitude by dwelling
tunefully upon such sentiments, it may reasonably be supposed
that they are not altogether uncongenial to her mind.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
He announced his presence by covering her eyes with his
hands, and lightly dropping a kiss on the top of her head.
When she had laughingly shaken herself free he lay down
on the grass at her feet, and, plucking a flower, commenced
to pull it to pieces.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need not have sung that song to the birds,&quot; he
declared, after a protracted survey of her fair face. &quot;They
need no such promptings, sweetest. They do obey their
hearts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose it is only meant for selfish human beings,
then,&quot; she answered somewhat plaintively. Then, moved
to a sudden impatience at her burden of doubts, she threw
her drawing-book on the ground, crying, &quot;But how very
futile to speak of birds. There is no comparison. What
concern have they with &#39;good-fame,&#39; or with any other
splendid responsibilities? We human beings have got
souls&mdash;or&mdash;or something of that sort, that we must consider,
haven&#39;t we?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think so!&quot; and the man&#39;s tone was mocking.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so do you,&quot; came the quick retort. &quot;You remember
that picture we looked at the other day? You
yourself said it had no soul in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s altogether different. The sort of soul I meant
is the gift of the Muses. Come, my Greek girl, have you
forgotten what you yourself told me about your precious
Socrates and his views on the necessity of &#39;divine madness&#39;
in creative work? Now I, in my turn, assure you
that the brightest amid the Nine never bestows souls on
those who refuse submission to Venus. Those who will
not bend the knee at that shrine remain forever sane&mdash;but
uninspired! You see, I know more of the classics than
you give me credit for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you believe that I love you, that you tell me
this? Oh, Morris, Morris dear, do understand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little darling, it is you who do not understand. Your
love for me is but that of a sweet child; you know nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
yet of that irresistible force that dominates the life of the
world. The soul, as you like to call it, that you already
possess, is sleeping. It has slept long enough, Evarne;
you must not be afraid of its awakening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How little you know me, it seems. I could never
care for you more than I do already. I&#39;m sure&mdash;oh,
you can&#39;t tell&mdash;but I&#39;m sure I bear already the very
fullest extent of love that my nature is capable of ever
producing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your believing that only proves the finite capacities
of the powers of imagination! You see, you cannot even
realise that there may be&mdash;and I assure you there are&mdash;possibilities
of emotion lying dormant within your mind
more powerful than you can even conceive of at present.
Only those who can, and who will, shake themselves free
from all hampering limitations ever become truly great
in any direction. It is quite useless to hope that the
&#39;divine madness&#39; of the Muses may be given to you, unless
you are already possessed of courage to seize on true freedom,
for that is the only soil in which anything worth
having can ever take root, thrive and grow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t quite understand,&quot; she murmured nervously,
reluctant to believe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In refusing to accept the full companionship of the man
who loves you, Evarne, and whom you love in return, you
are simply enslaving your emotions, enchaining them, and
hopelessly preventing their perfect development. The
technique of your chosen Art you will doubtless gain by
time and perseverance, but you are scornfully neglecting
to bring to fruition a far more subtle source of power&mdash;the
rich ripeness of soul that alone can appeal to humanity&#39;s
soul&mdash;the flame that can set blazing the fire that lies at
the heart of the race of man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne again parted her lips as if to speak, but without
hesitation Morris went on with his homily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
&quot;Whether you set forth to create pictures or books or
music, you cannot possibly give more to the children of
your brain than is to be found within your own innermost
self. Only by having known the most intense, the loftiest,
the deepest, in the whole range of emotional experience
will you be enabled to put knowledge into your work,
and without that, what worth has any work of Art? Believe
me, ignorance cannot possibly ring true&mdash;truth alone
can live and enthral.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, believe me or not, as you like, Evarne, but I
assure you that because of all this, love is the one and only
teacher that can really evolve a great artist. Forgive me
for thus assailing you on all sides, my sweet iceberg, but
your happiness and success are very dear to me. I simply
cannot bear to see you thus blindly and ignorantly opposing
the unfolding of the bright flower of your genius. As I started
by saying, your soul is still sleeping, and it will slumber on
until you can become reconciled to letting love awaken it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A protracted silence followed these last words. Evarne
continued to gaze at Morris with the rapt expression she
always wore when he was pouring fresh thoughts into her
mind. This suggestion of a triple alliance between illicit
love, the possession of a soul, and success in Art, possessed
all the charms and the startling qualities of novelty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are trying to make me think selfishly,&quot; she murmured
at last, &quot;but you must never believe that my
own progress is of more consequence to me than&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She
looked at him in silence again, and her eyes and her thoughts
grew full of tenderness. Clasping her hands together, she
went on, &quot;And oh! if it were, I&#39;m sure, oh! so sure, that
the love I feel for you already is&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not of the sort that counts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Socrates says that pure love&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris interrupted her. He felt that this troublesome
antique philosopher must be resolutely suppressed once and
for all.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;I cannot claim as intimate an acquaintance with the
opinions of that gentleman as you possess, little sage;
nevertheless, I&#39;ll be bound that he supports my opinion.
I can&#39;t definitely remember, mark you; I am only sure on
general principles that no one who taught your pretty,
sentimental rubbish&mdash;forgive me, sweetheart&mdash;could have
contrived to get himself accepted for so long. You look&mdash;or
rather we will seek together&mdash;and I&#39;ll warrant that I
find and show you confirmation of my words.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">That night Evarne retired considerably earlier than
usual, but unable to sleep, and soon utterly weary of the
darkness and her own tangled thoughts, she resolved to
follow Morris&#39;s advice of the afternoon. She would delve
once more into that master-mind that they had both
invoked as upholding their contrary ideals.</p>

<p class="indent">Flashing on the light, she went into the red room, and
returned with her arms filled with the six big volumes of
Plato. Tumbling them all on the table by her side she
slipped into bed again, and reclining comfortably amid her
soft, faintly-perfumed pillows, drew a volume at random
from the pile, then hesitated a moment before opening it.</p>

<p class="indent">She had perfect confidence that in these works of Plato
no sentiments would be found of the nature that Morris
sought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear one is unwise, after holding up fame and
success as a bribe, to send me to read this&mdash;which is my
Bible&mdash;and which teaches that happiness lies only in the
pursuit of wisdom, of virtue, of all that is good,&quot; was her
thought, as she lazily laid open the pages. Little did she
deem that her bewildering doubts and difficulties were at
length to be definitely solved.</p>

<p class="indent">It is hard to avoid the terrible belief that there exists a
malign omnipotent Spirit at enmity with the race of man;
an evil Power untiringly concentrated on watching for and
contriving opportunities to work dire mischief&mdash;to create
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
miseries of all kinds&mdash;to impose agony of mind and body
upon all that has life. Not without some show of reason
have there ever been secret sects of devil-worshippers, who
recognise the existence of, and seek to propitiate, this force
so hostile to humanity, this merciless Something that works
with superhuman ingenuity to aid and bring to fruition
that which is of itself&mdash;evil&mdash;to conquer, to destroy, to
render impotent all that which is of a contrary nature;
or more terrible still, to bend such to its own purposes,
employing all that is best and noblest and sweetest in life
and human nature as tools wherewith to work destruction.</p>

<p class="indent">Within a few minutes of opening the Oracle, Evarne was
sitting erect, all her sleepy indifference and listlessness
gone. Throughout all the time of her mental stress she
had not appealed to these familiar works. What more
could a further study of Socrates do than intensify her
desire to remain his faithful disciple? She had deemed it
quite useless to look for special guidance as to which of the
two opposing courses open to her really led to the acquisition
of true wisdom, virtue, and spiritual beauty. That
she should now open directly at one of those strangely rare
definite statements concerning right and wrong, was a
coincidence so extraordinary that it is difficult to believe
that a controlling intelligence had not arranged this
apparent chance.</p>

<p class="indent">She re-read the sentence upon which her eye had fallen,
vaguely wondering how she could ever have forgotten
its doctrine. It was a portion of the &quot;Phædrus,&quot; and
referred to that eternal topic, love, or rather to a certain
imitation of the glorious reality. This semblance was
characterised as &quot;being mingled with mortal prudence,
and dispensing mortal and niggardly gifts,&quot; and its dire
result was &quot;to generate in the soul an illiberality which is
praised by the multitude as virtue, but which will cause
it to be tossed about the earth and beneath the earth for
nine thousand years, devoid of intelligence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
Naturally, it was not a belief in the threatened aftermath
of harbouring this &quot;illiberality&quot; that appalled her. It
was the sudden revelation that the inspired Socrates&mdash;far
from upholding and approving her present discreet line of
conduct&mdash;would have condemned her for &quot;illiberality
praised by the multitude as virtue,&quot; as unhesitatingly as
she was now willing to confess that she herself held it in
contempt! After the first moment&#39;s shock she found
comfort in the reflection that the opinion at which she had
arrived independently, albeit slowly and reluctantly,
found confirmation in the words of this great teacher.</p>

<p class="indent">Something outside herself now seemed to take possession
of her body, and to control her deeds. Immediate action
became imperative. Instinctively, almost mechanically,
she sprang out of bed, flung her white silk dressing-gown
around her, and sped barefooted along the corridor and up
the little flight of stairs that led to Morris&#39;s rooms.</p>

<p class="indent">There was still a light showing under the door; quite
steadfastly and without hesitation she turned the handle,
and when it refused to yield she rattled it violently. Hearing
a quick step inside she felt the blood surge to her head,
but no suggestion of faltering or regret came to trouble her
finally settled conviction. This seemingly wild impulse&mdash;being
in reality the climax of long reflection&mdash;was far from
being a transient ebullition of feeling. It was rooted in her
will; and Evarne&#39;s will, once fairly turned in any direction,
was impervious to conflicting influences.</p>

<p class="indent">In the unnaturally exalted state to which her highly-strung
nervous system had now lifted her, it would have
seemed a mere nothing to have walked into an arena of
wild beasts for the sake of the man she loved&mdash;easy to have
flung herself upon swords to give him happiness&mdash;yea, she
would unhesitatingly have followed him to hell itself had
he beckoned. Are those amid mankind who never knew
the &quot;madness&quot; of Eros to be pitied or envied?</p>

<h2><a name="chVII" id="chVII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>ROSES AND RAPTURES</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> a time of fair summer, amid varied scenes of beauty,
the next phase of Evarne&#39;s life glided past&mdash;vivid,
brilliantly happy&mdash;as devoid of apprehension or
sense of finality as is the dream of a lotus-eater.
As the spring advanced, and Naples became over-sultry
for those reared in northern climes, Morris took her to
cooler regions. Together they wandered through Switzerland
and the Austrian Tyrol, and only with the approach
of the winter season were they again in residence at &quot;Mon
Bijou.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With the ensuing spring, Morris&#39;s restless spirit once
more asserted itself, and the summer saw them in London.
There he held a social position which led him into circles
where no man can introduce a woman who occupies the
position Evarne now held. But he saw that plenty of
diversions and gaieties of one kind and another came her
way. She was still interested in her Art, and, happy in love
given and returned, she wasted no sighs over those society
gatherings from which she was forever strictly tabooed.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris studied appearances to the extent of paying an
occasional brief visit to Mrs. Kenyon at their country home;
in the autumn, too, he sometimes left Evarne to her own
devices in the flat wherein she was mistress, while he
joined shooting parties at various country houses. But at
the first breath of winter he was quite ready to be coaxed
back to the girl&#39;s little Paradise on earth, &quot;Mon Bijou.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On their settling down once more at Naples, she was again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
seen at Florelli&#39;s, bent on making up for lost time. Her
artistic studies had been of necessity but intermittent.
In Morris she beheld her paramount duty; he had been as
ardent and jealous as any young lover, lamenting and
grudging every minute that Art took her from his service.
He laughed at the persistence with which she continued to
snatch stray hours for drawing. Her future was his care
now, he insisted. He hated to think of those soft, brown
eyes squandering their beams upon inanimate objects.
Why did she want to waste any of the precious hours of
her glorious youth shut up in a crowded, overheated studio,
that stank of paint and turpentine and microbes and
humanity?</p>

<p class="indent">But Evarne had not entirely abandoned the study of
Philosophy for that of Love. She told him, with fascinating
seriousness, that in order to maintain the mental
balance that was described as &quot;Happiness,&quot; it was necessary
to both cultivate and provide an outlet for the intellectual
faculties, as well as for those impulses that were
revelling with such joyous abandon amid &quot;the roses and
raptures of vice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus she was sadly disappointed when, within a fortnight
of settling down once more seriously to work, Morris
announced that he was going to Paris for a week or two,
and of course expected her to accompany him.</p>

<p class="indent">She had just arrived at one of those stages, so delightful
to pass through in any study, when a distinct advance in
power is felt. The close of each day&#39;s efforts left her with
the exhilarating feeling of having surpassed herself&mdash;of
having successfully overstepped her previous highest limit.
To abandon her work at this crisis was the last thing she
desired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Morris, dearest,&quot; she pouted in sudden protest, &quot;why
do we wander about so very much? It is so delightful
here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I must go to Paris now. I have business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
&quot;I thought you never had to do anything you didn&#39;t
want to? Anyway, dearie, couldn&#39;t you live without me
for a fortnight? I know how it will be! If you have got
me with you we shall end up by roaming all through the
winter, but if I am here at &#39;Mon Bijou,&#39; waiting for you&mdash;why,
then, you will return quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris protested, but in the end Evarne for once took
her own way. It was quite unusual for her not immediately
and unhesitatingly to set aside her own wishes
should they chance to conflict with those of her lover;
on the other hand, Morris always duly consulted her
respecting the plans and arrangements of their mutual life,
and had never realised how entirely it was his will alone
that controlled their movements. Now his vanity was
wounded&mdash;not so much that she should question his arrangements,
as that the form the opposition took should
actually imply her willingness to bear a separation. It
was something fresh and strange in his wide experience,
and&mdash;to his way of thinking&mdash;far from flattering! What
he always expected was the necessity of soothing jealous
fears and apprehensions arising from periods of absence
of his own making.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus he went off with a feeling of displeasure against
Evarne that was new. He did not comprehend that it was
the very knowledge of the strength of her own affection
that enabled her to see him leave the arc of her personal
magnetism and influence without feeling any anxiety.
In London she had been forced to spend days alone while
he was in the company of others&mdash;women, high-born,
beautiful, no doubt&mdash;yet she had never feared for his
loyalty. Sweet, blind trust!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Shortly after his return from Paris, Morris showed that
he had no intention of spending the whole of the winter
and spring at Naples, as he had done during the two
previous years.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ve got a bright idea,&quot; he announced one evening.
&quot;Let us spend the winter in Egypt, voyaging up the Nile
with a party of our gayest, jolliest pals. What say you,
Evarne? I know of a dahabeah, built for private use, that
has lost its income, I suppose, for now it&#39;s willing to let
itself out on hire. I wrote concerning it, and here&#39;s the
answer, together with any number of photographs, both of
its personal appearance and its internal regions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He passed over a pile of papers, which the girl studied
with keen interest. Morris, Naples and the studio was a
triple combination that it had seemed impossible to improve
upon; nevertheless, Morris, Egypt and a gay, bright party
formed a decidedly alluring prospect if an alternate programme
for the winter months was not to be avoided.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, whom would you like to invite? We must resign
ourselves beforehand to the idea that it will probably be
the grand finale of our acquaintance with all whom we
honour by our choice. The best of friends invariably
quarrel on long voyages.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You and I will set them such an example that concord
and harmony will reign supreme, won&#39;t we? <i>Absit omen.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I really think we may defy Fate on that point, little
sweetheart. Now, to business! We can have eight
besides our charming selves. Let&#39;s ask the Varesios&mdash;see
what they gain by being able to speak English. Then
there are those rowdy Philmers from London&mdash;that&#39;s four.
Then Giuseppe&mdash;he&#39;ll keep us lively too; he&#39;s like a jolly
English boy, isn&#39;t he? Not too overwhelmingly polite.
Then there&#39;s Tom Talling&mdash;we must have some more
women, mustn&#39;t we?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think equal numbers are best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, wise young judge! Well, look here, we can transport
Talling to heaven as well as Egypt if we like to give him
permission to invite that little French girl he&#39;s so mad over&mdash;Justine
Feronnier, she&#39;s called. She&#39;s a quiet, demure
little minx, with curious, flaxen hair. She looks down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
side of her nose all the time, as if she had just come out of
a convent school. I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t dislike her, and
I should be glad to do Tom a good turn. Do you mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a bit. Who else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Um-m-m, who? Good gracious, I was forgetting Tony
Belmont.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The man you were with so much in Paris last month?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s it. He must come, and we will tell him to bring
Lucinda.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is Lucinda another little minx, like Tom&#39;s friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she chooses to describe herself as Mrs. Belmont,
and it wouldn&#39;t be kind to show undue curiosity concerning
the date and place of the wedding ceremony.
We&#39;ve settled upon one too many, haven&#39;t we? But
Guiseppe is well accustomed to being tucked in as a sort
of makeweight, so I declare this parliament prorogued.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, what is the dahabeah called?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The Waterfowl&#39; at present, but that&#39;s only fit for a
houseboat on the Thames. I shall rechristen her &#39;Evarne
the Beautiful,&#39;&quot; and Morris smiled indulgently.</p>

<p class="indent">But the girl shook her head, declaring with a touch of
coquettish self-confidence that she could not consent to
such a name being chosen. One Evarne the Beautiful
was quite enough to occupy all his thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, Lady Vanity, you must exercise your own
ingenuity,&quot; he answered, and after a moment&#39;s solemn
hesitation over the rival merits of &quot;The River Queen&quot;
and &quot;The Radiant Isis,&quot; Evarne decided on the latter
name as more appropriate to a craft destined to breast the
waters of Old Nile.</p>

<p class="indent">Each desired guest accepted the invitation with flattering
alacrity, and ere long &quot;The Radiant Isis&quot; was fairly off
upon her voyage up the great river of the land of the
Pharaohs.</p>

<h2><a name="chVIII" id="chVIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>LUCINDA BELMONT</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">All</span> the guests were quite well known to their young
hostess with the exception of Mdlle. Feronnier
and Tony and Lucinda Belmont. As Morris
had said, there was little, so far as the average
observer could discern, either to like or to dislike in the
quiet, flaxen-haired, little French girl. Lucinda Belmont,
on the contrary, possessed a distinct and striking personality.
Erect in carriage, and bearing herself with an
air of unassailable self-confidence&mdash;with a full bust, and a
waist so disproportionately tiny that Evarne surveyed it
with mingled scorn and wonder&mdash;she was unmistakably
what is popularly meant by &quot;a fine woman.&quot; Her big
eyes, fringed by long, black lashes, were the tiniest bit
protruding, whereby they were enabled to roll up and down
and round about in wondrous glances, languishing or
flashing, according to the requirements of the occasion.
Her features were ordinary, yet her vivacity, her animation,
together with her carefully chosen costumes, her
elaborate coiffure, and the brilliance given by a most
discreet and effective use of paint and powder, transformed
her into a woman who excited appreciative attention
from most men.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite her now considerable store of worldly wisdom,
Evarne had not got rid of a somewhat unwise confidence
in humanity. Tennyson tells how Vivian was able to see
evil of one sort or another in the most noble of characters
through the simple method of &quot;imputing her own vileness&quot;
to the thoughts, the deeds, the motives of others. In
the same manner did Evarne instinctively credit everyone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
with her own loyalty and honour. Assuredly Justine
Feronnier and Lucinda were both unusually striking
representatives of the female sex as far as appearance
went. But the French girl was understood to belong to
Tom Talling, and Lucinda&mdash;politely described as Mrs.
Belmont&mdash;had the legitimate owner of that surname in
attendance upon her, so Evarne experienced no unpleasant
anxiety in beholding the attractive flaxen demureness of
the one, or the flashing brunette brilliance of the other.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The long days devoted to the uneventful journey of
&quot;The Radiant Isis&quot; through the flat reaches of the lower
Nile were relieved from monotony by the spirit of mirth
that possessed all aboard. Morris had indeed chosen his
companions with discrimination, if frivolity and constant
laughter were what he sought.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course each individual was provided with that hallmark
of the traveller in the East, a hand-camera, and the
results of the snap-shots of these amateur photographers
caused many a shriek of laughter. Morris, Guiseppe and
Signor Varesio had all brought their foils. But neither
Italian had much chance against Morris, who was quite
a champion in this art, to which he owed much of that
slim, youthful-looking figure that was his pride. Then
there were games, dances, visits from Arab entertainers,
fantasias by the crew&mdash;all serving to make time pass
delightfully.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet, slowly but surely, unhappiness crept in. The
whole trouble had root in the resolute transference of
Tony Belmont&#39;s ardent attentions from Lucinda to the
altogether unappreciative Evarne. She found him always
by her side, even when it must have been obvious to
the meanest intelligence that she and Morris were more
than contented alone. At first she bore his society with
outward patience, but soon there came an irritated dislike
to this destroyer of so many pleasant <i>tête-à-têtes</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
between herself and the man who still ruled her entire
heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Besides, there was the deserted, disconsolate, sulky
Lucinda to worry about, and since neither Evarne&#39;s
snubs nor hints, or even actual commands, could drive
Tony back to his neglected privileges, it became obviously
Morris&#39;s duty as host to do his best to prevent the forsaken
one from feeling too overwhelmingly lonely. So it
came gradually to pass, to Evarne&#39;s dismay, that Morris
spent most of his time by Mrs. Belmont.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl felt herself so helpless; in the privacy of
their cabin Morris always answered her loving complaints
so gently and affectionately, deploring the fact but insisting
on its necessity and its temporary nature, that she
sought at first to be trustful and comforted. But the
time came when she could no longer refuse to see that
her lover was, in sooth, fully satisfied with the present
state of affairs, and desired no other.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the days grew full of anguish to the girl. Justine
alone noticed aught amiss, and showed a desire to advise
as how best to cope with the situation. But Evarne
could not bring herself to actually acknowledge that here
she was suddenly plunged into a vulgar struggle with
another woman&mdash;and one so coarse, ignorant and inferior
to herself&mdash;for the possession of a man.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead, all that her youthful wisdom prompted was
to strive to arouse jealous doubts and fears in Morris&#39;s
breast. So, for a weary, dreary day or two she was
bewilderingly responsive to Tony&#39;s dull talk and banal
and often over-bold compliments. But all she gained, as
her laugh rang out gay and bright enough to rivet attention,
was an indulgent smile from Morris, and the irritating
remark from Lucinda&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How splendidly you two do get on together! And
I&#39;ll warrant all your little jokes are secret, so that Mr.
Kenyon and I must be resigned to be left out in the cold.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chIX" id="chIX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>HOW EGYPT WAS RUINED FOR EVARNE</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At</span> length the dahabeah drew up by the wharf of
Luxor. From the beginning of the cruise the
arrival at this world-famed spot had been eagerly
anticipated, and on the very first morning the
travellers gaily mounted donkeys and set forth on the short
journey to the ruined Temples of Karnak. The spirited
animals that they rode&mdash;so very different from the poor
little European drudges that go by the same name&mdash;covered
the ground with celerity, the dusky donkey-boys running
hard behind, keeping up with difficulty, yet shouting and
flourishing their sticks, to urge on any of the fiery mounts
that showed signs of a failing lack of ambition to be foremost
in the race.</p>

<p class="indent">On arriving at Karnak, loud was the expression of
amazement at the extent of country over which was
spread the ruins of this vast collection of temples, with
their halls, their courts, their huge entrances, their obelisks,
columns and statues.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe really it would be quite possible that one
should lose one&#39;s self hopelessly amid all these ruins,&quot; declared
little Justine, her pale face still flushed from the
fun of the amusing gallop.</p>

<p class="indent">The only dismal countenance in the party was that of
Hassan, their dragoman. This gorgeous and most self-satisfied
personage was always rather inclined to sulk
when expeditions were in progress. He then looked upon
his lot as that of a much injured individual. Morris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
knew Egypt well, and his interesting talks on the topic
had made the old history and religion intensely attractive
to Evarne before and during the voyage. He now
very rightly considered himself a far more interesting
cicerone than the verbosely ignorant Arab. He therefore
restricted Hassan to the mere business details, while he
himself undertook the task of conducting his guests, of
enlightening their ignorance and training their taste.</p>

<p class="indent">As time passed and the day grew in heat, luncheon
became the next item on the programme, and at this
point Hassan, coming into a portion of his kingdom again,
brightened perceptibly. He carefully spread out the
dainty meal in the shadow cast by a great wall, whereon
sculptured pictorial records of the war-triumphs of a
Pharaoh dead for thousands of years still preserved his
royal memory green to posterity. Then, seating the
company, the dragoman waited upon them with satisfied
importance.</p>

<p class="indent">After all had recruited their strength for the afternoon&#39;s
further exploration, Morris suggested that they should
mount the sandy slope and stone steps that led to the
summit of the pylon&mdash;the great gate that formed the
entrance to the whole of the ruins. The view thus obtained
was wonderful, he assured them; the sun was not too
hot to defy the shelter provided by veils and parasols,
while any cool breezes that might chance to be wandering
around would be more easily found at a height. Thus
encouraged, everyone started with such energy up the
long, severe slope, that within a very few minutes a halt
had to be called, while all stood and panted breathlessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More haste, less speed,&quot; declared Morris. &quot;Now,
Mrs. Belmont, you and I will play tortoise to their hare,
and we will just see who gets to the top first.&quot; And,
proffering his arm as a support to Lucinda, he encouraged
her to persevere.</p>

<p class="indent">Tony, who had been sitting cross-legged on the sand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
sprang to his feet, and with a sweeping bow offered Evarne
a similar attention. She accepted it with a smile, and in
due course the summit was attained.</p>

<p class="indent">Certainly it was worth the trouble. In the background,
against the vividly blue sweep of lofty skies, appeared the
sharp and clearly-defined outline of the arid, rose-tinted
hills, concealed amid whose rocky recesses lay the tombs
of the Pharaohs of bygone days. In the mid-distance
the wide Nile&mdash;here dignified and placid, untroubled by
dams, reservoirs or cataracts&mdash;flowed calmly and gently,
cool even to behold.</p>

<p class="indent">Between the water and the temple the eye roved over
pastures, carefully cultivated, often of a most vivid emerald,
broken by clusters of lofty, feathery palm-trees. In the
fields and on the pale dusty roads were Arabs, their many-hued
garments adding to the rich brightness of the scene,
yet without rendering it at all <i>voyante</i>. Over all was the
glamour of a dancing haze of golden sunlight.</p>

<p class="indent">Near to the pylon, the Old and the New appeared in
close conjunction. To the left lay a temple, ruinous yet
still massive, and another pylon, far older than the Christian
religion, but still almost uninjured by its vast weight
of years. Nearer still stretched a wide avenue bordered
on either hand by rows of huge ram-headed sphinxes.</p>

<p class="indent">To the right of these great works of times long past,
lay a tiny poverty-stricken Arab village. It stood in the
midst of a thin grove of palms, and was then encircled by
an irregular wall of mud bricks. The small houses, also
of dried mud, had, for the most part, been erected by their
provident builders around the trunks of palm-trees, which
helped support the huts, and gave some degree of shelter
from the fiery rays of the broiling summer sun. The flat
roofs were covered with piles of sugar-cane, amid which
played naked brown babies and small ragged children.
The terrifying half-savage dogs that defended the village
and all its belongings during the hours of night, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
basked peacefully in the mid-day warmth, or strolled
around the top of the encircling wall.</p>

<p class="indent">The summit of the pylon itself, though fairly wide, was
rough and steep. Its height was great, and the extensive
view accentuated the feeling of loftiness. But Evarne&#39;s
few years of &quot;softness&quot; and luxury had not sufficed to
entirely undo the effects of her early training. The sensation
of height had small effect upon her well-trained nerves,
and when she wished to gaze particularly into one special
little courtyard within the village, she walked boldly to
the farther end and edge of the pylon.</p>

<p class="indent">As the party had neared the top their ears had been
greeted by the sound of numerous voices uplifted in unison;
on gaining this point of vantage the source of these cries
could be seen.</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently death had visited the village that day, for the
courtyard of one of the largest of the small houses was
filled with women wailing and lamenting, while little knots
of females were approaching with all speed from the entire
countryside. Clad in their shapeless and voluminous
black robes, with trailing ends leaving clouds of dust
in their wake, their heads veiled, their faces hidden in
the yashmak, they formed a strange, weird spectacle as
they advanced, all uttering concerted cries of mourning
that grew louder as they neared the village in which the
dead man lay. The European witnesses of this phase of
native life were convinced that only the departure to
another world of one of the male half of humanity would
have sufficed to create such a stir in the surrounding
district.</p>

<p class="indent">A band of mourners reached their goal. Their arrival
was the signal for the already assembled women of the
village to wax yet more demonstrative in their display of
anguish. The long shuddering moans, the shrill piercing
cries, grew louder and more insistent, while dozens of lean
brown arms were raised in despairing appeal to heaven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
then descended with force upon head or face, and others
of the mourners tore frantically at the garments over their
breasts.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s just as it is drawn on the ancient monuments, the
very same; they haven&#39;t changed a bit in all these thousands
of years,&quot; cried Evarne. She was far more thrilled
by this illustration of the realism of Egyptian art and
of this justification for that romantic term&mdash;The Unchanging
East&mdash;than moved to sorrow by the conventional
mourning of the many wailers.</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently the news had spread widely. From all directions
black figures bore down upon the village, sometimes
in groups of six or eight, sometimes in bodies of thirty or
more. Each one on her arrival passed into the low hut wherein
the corpse lay, then came out after a minute or so to add
her quota to the increasing lamentation for the dead. This
business of mourning was clearly still the prerogative of
the female sex. No men took any share in it&mdash;indeed, the
only two existing in the whole place, as far as could be
seen, were squatting calmly in a neighbouring yard, unconcernedly
holding and milking a buffalo.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne looked round for Morris. He stood just at the
top of the slope, Lucinda still clinging to his arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along to where I am, Morris,&quot; the girl called out
to him. &quot;You can see everything much better from here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a movement as if to follow her suggestion, but
Lucinda said something in a low voice, whereupon he
replied&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Belmont feels too giddy either to walk or to be
left alone; but don&#39;t you bother about us, my dear.
We can really witness all the fun of the fair quite nicely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That chap may have died of fever or smallpox, or
goodness knows what,&quot; remarked Tony&#39;s voice by her ear.
&quot;With all these women trotting in to have a last stare at
the old boy&mdash;why, it&#39;s enough to infect the neighbourhood,
isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
To Evarne the Jealous the health of the whole countryside
was as nothing at that moment compared to the fact
that when she had directly called upon her lover to join
her, Lucinda should have had the assurance to promptly
whisper a suggestion that he should remain where he was,
and that the wish of her rival should have sufficed to keep
Morris from her side.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned to Tony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take my smelling-salts over to Mrs. Belmont,&quot; she
said, opening her hand-bag and producing the little crystal
bottle with its jewelled stopper. &quot;Stay by her and look
after her if she feels bad, won&#39;t you, so that Mr. Kenyon
may come here where it is easier to see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But a different remedy for overcoming the lady&#39;s attack
of nausea had already been prescribed. Supported by
Morris&#39;s arm she had commenced to descend from the
height.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne instinctively uttered a little exclamation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let &#39;em go,&quot; suggested Tony. &quot;We don&#39;t want to
go down yet, do we, Miss Stornway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne glanced around at the remainder of her companions.
Tom and Justine were seated close together
on a stone by her side, apparently as rooted to the spot as
ever Theseus and Pitheous could have been; the others
were grouped near at hand, all staring downwards with the
keenest interest.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was obliged to agree. Nature had been very
neglectful in not imbuing her with the art of scheming
and contriving events to suit her own purposes. True,
she had now a daily object-lesson in the man&oelig;uvres of the
adept Lucinda, and without being conscious thereof, her
education in this direction was in progress. However, she
was still in the very early stages, and could devise no
method on the spur of the moment for preventing this
hateful division of the party.</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head and pursed up her mouth discontentedly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
&quot;It&#39;s very evident that no one else wishes to descend
yet awhile,&quot; she acknowledged. &quot;Just ask Mr. Kenyon,
then, where we shall find him when we do return to earth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tony left her side, and as rapidly came back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s arranged that we are to have tea at four o&#39;clock
on the same spot where we lunched. Kenyon says let&#39;s
meet there at that hour, and all wander about anywhere
we choose for the rest of the afternoon. If there&#39;s anything
particular we want to see again, Hassan knows the
way about. That&#39;s all right, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She nodded, but dared not trust herself to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t we tired of this diversion?&quot; cried Guiseppe,
joining them a couple of minutes later, his bright spirit
having no inclination to dwell long on aught connected
with death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The others are not, but that is no reason why you
should remain,&quot; she answered rather eagerly. &quot;Anyone
who does not want another hour at least up here is to go
with Mr. Kenyon. Hurry up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She experienced a certain malicious delight in the
idea that she had thus counteracted Lucinda&#39;s trick, but
her self-congratulation was but short-lived. Guiseppe
promptly returned to her side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kenyon says Mrs. Belmont&#39;s head is too bad to stand
my noisy chatter,&quot; he explained. &quot;Noisy chatter, d&#39;you
hear, Tony, old boy? My noisy chatter, forsooth! That
to me, the most timid, retiring violet of the whole lot of
you,&quot; and he set to work to prove his words by causing the
very echoes to ring with his clear musical laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne clenched her hands, and a ferment of emotions
tore her breast. Of course she had known all along that
Morris was perfectly capable of procuring <i>solitude à deux</i>
in the face of any difficulties if such were his wish. Now
this proved it! It was his will, not his ingenuity, that
had failed, when subduing Tony&#39;s attentions to herself
had been the problem.</p>

<h2><a name="chX" id="chX"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
<small>THE SHRINE OF SEKHET</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At</span> the hour appointed for tea they all headed their
course towards the site chosen for meals, and
there, already seated on the rugs, comfortably
leaning against the wall, were Lucinda and her
escort.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where have you been?&quot; shouted Guiseppe. &quot;You
don&#39;t know what we&#39;ve just been learning, ignorant ones
that you are. The columns in the great hall are three
thousand five hundred feet high, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no! three thousand five hundred years old,&quot; he
was corrected.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I retire crushed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need a cup of tea to revive your failing mental
powers. So do we all.&quot; And ere long the spirit-stove
boiled away merrily and the general desire was gratified.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have indeed missed an interesting sight this
afternoon,&quot; declared Signora Varesio.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My unfortunate giddiness!&quot; sighed Lucinda plaintively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What have you seen to compensate for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, we have been over to a little temple&mdash;most interesting.
But I was fated to receive shocks this afternoon.
In it there is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t tell,&quot; interposed Morris. &quot;After tea we will
take them all over and let them make the discovery for
themselves. It will delight you, Evarne, I&#39;m certain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As he spoke he looked across at the girl with that tender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
smile that always penetrated to her very heart. It could
do much even now to heal that dull ache that would make
itself felt despite her belief in his repeated assurances of
the fixity of his affection towards her sweet self, and her
consequent faith that the affair with Lucinda was a mere
temporary flirtation. She tried hard to be reasonable,
and so long as she could think that Morris&#39;s earnest
and serious love was still hers, and that the attraction
any other woman might have for him was merely temporary,
she felt that&mdash;although a degree of anxiety and
apprehension was inevitable&mdash;she ought to be able to look
down from the superior heights of constancy and make
allowances for that dancing butterfly&mdash;a man&#39;s fancy.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, this course of diplomacy&mdash;laid down by that most
successful of royal mistresses, Madame de Pompadour&mdash;is
difficult and painful indeed when the heart-happiness of
the resident on the superior heights depends wholly upon
the vagaries of the butterfly. Moreover, Evarne&#39;s poor
little vanity was receiving a series of severe blows. For
so long she had been accustomed to being first and foremost
in Morris&#39;s regard&mdash;to seeing the society of all other
women set aside, if at all possible, for her own. Now,
despite her combination of trust and philosophy, this new
state of affairs was a protracted anguish. She was resolutely
brave under it&mdash;perhaps too much so to be quite
pleasing or flattering to Morris. Even the deep-rooted
hatred she bore Lucinda was almost entirely hidden.</p>

<p class="indent">When the slight meal was ended and the moment came
for once more setting forth, Mrs. Belmont arose with
a childishly pretty air of happy importance. &quot;Now I must
be dragoman,&quot; she declared, and proceeded to lead the
way amid the ruined masses of stone and fallen columns.
But she was soon fain to confess that she could not remember
the track, and called upon Morris for aid.</p>

<p class="indent">Smiling, he took the lead. Poor Evarne! Life seemed
to have become a series of heart-squeezings. Her keen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
eye noted the smile that was flashed upon Lucinda, and
it appeared to her to be every whit as indulgent and
kindly&mdash;almost as caressing&mdash;as that which had hitherto
been reserved for herself alone.</p>

<p class="indent">It was necessary to cover quite a long distance over a
plain besprinkled not only with fallen stones, but with a
long spiky growth that rendered progress difficult.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is well worth this walk,&quot; declared Morris, joining
her after a while, &quot;for what we are going to see is the
most perfectly-preserved temple in the whole of Karnak.
It is very small, but one gets from it a better idea of what
these buildings must have looked like in their palmy days
than the larger ruins can show.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Talking about &#39;perfectly preserved,&#39; why didn&#39;t the
old &#39;Gyps pickle their &#39;corpsies&#39; instead of bothering to
stuff them?&quot; demanded Tony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be nasty,&quot; retorted Evarne curtly; and a few
minutes later the goal was reached.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, go in one by one,&quot; suggested Morris, &quot;and
ladies, be prepared for a shock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Despite this warning, Evarne could hardly suppress a
little cry as she, in her turn, entered alone into the inner
sanctuary of the tiny temple. Its walls were completely
decorated with richly coloured representations of weird
deities and worshipping mortals. There was no window,
but the rays of the sinking sun filtered in through a small
opening in the roof. The chamber was dim and gloomy,
but the one square beam of light was arranged to fall
with concentrated force upon a solitary upstanding statue
in polished black basalt. It depicted a slender woman&#39;s
form, surmounted by a cat&#39;s head. So perfect was it in
every detail, so realistic, so full of quiet animation, that
for a moment Evarne had believed herself to be in the
presence of something living and dreadful.</p>

<p class="indent">Almost immediately, of course, she realised her mistake,
and knew it for what it was&mdash;a representation of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
ancient Egyptian goddess Sekhet. Already that day the
girl had stood in the middle of an open field&mdash;once the
site of a great temple, of which the ruins lay all about&mdash;and
gazed around the extensive circle of large, gleaming,
black marble statues of Sekhet that now alone remained
to hint at the departed grandeur of this vanished temple.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne&#39;s brown eyes had grown graver, and all-unconsciously
she had sighed deeply as she stood amidst those
numerous Sekhets seated beneath the clear blue sky.
They had struck strange awe to her heart, these symbolic
counterfeits of the goddess who presided over the most
powerful&mdash;the most eternal&mdash;forces in heaven and earth,
Sekhet&mdash;goddess both of Love and of Cruelty! Ah, they
were a subtle people, those ancient Egyptians, skilful in
reading the heart of humanity, fearless of the truth, defiant
in stripping the gloss from life!</p>

<p class="indent">The light laughter and exclamations of her companions
had jarred upon Evarne&#39;s ear. She felt weighed down
with an unreasoning reverence. These solemn figures in
the great ruined hall of the temple had seemed instinct
with a supernatural power. Battered by the passing of
much time, discredited for centuries as representing a
great divinity&mdash;objects but of curiosity and wonder to this
age&mdash;they had yet appealed to her as invested with the
calm complacency of conscious power. Serenely they sat,
confidently awaiting at least the individual recognition
and homage of mankind. Strangely did they convey the
idea that theirs was the triumphant knowledge that, for
so long as human hearts can pulsate, for so long, too,
Sekhet&mdash;the personification of Love and Lust, and the
suffering both bring&mdash;shall find her throne, her shrine,
her arena.</p>

<p class="indent">This figure that Evarne now stood before was not seated.
Somewhat over life-size it stood, stiffly erect, one foot
advanced, the symbol of Life held in its grasp. It was
raised above the sand of the floor on a low pedestal. Evarne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
stood motionless, gazing upwards. The battered figures
in the open had been impressive, but this one&mdash;uninjured,
and with the artificial advantage of its surroundings&mdash;was
more than that! It was terrible, awe-inspiring, with its
inhuman head, the menacing feline features bearing so
clearly the impress of unpitying and vindictive cruelty,
malignant spite, merciless joy in the inflicting and witnessing
of the direst agonies that can rack tortured brain
or flesh or spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne had been the last to enter, and as she rejoined
her companions outside, the party commenced to retrace
its steps. Unperceived, she left them and returned to the
temple. She had something to say to Sekhet.</p>

<p class="indent">Alone she stood, facing the goddess&mdash;the lifeless marble
into which the hand of an artist, long since pulseless, had
wrought this unhallowed expression with such marvellous
realism that it was difficult to remember that no knowledge,
no power, no fearsome intelligence, lay behind those
gleaming eyes, that low animal brow. Evarne stood
motionless, gazing intently up at the brutal face, trying to
forget her own individuality and all that was modern.
It had been a little prayer that was in her heart as she
hastened back, but now she shook her head slowly as the
conception of the innate and unalterable cruelty of Sekhet
impressed itself with yet greater force upon her mind. This
was a goddess who surely had ever been more inclined to
fulfil curses than to answer prayers.</p>

<p class="indent">As she commenced her half-whispered appeal she recalled
some of the titles under which this cat-headed
image had been invoked&mdash;doubtless many a time and oft&mdash;in
the dim and distant past. &quot;Oh, Queen of the Goddesses!
Oh, Crusher of Hearts! If you can hear me
and still wield power, let just tribulation fall on all those
who set forth to steal a love that is not free for them&mdash;a
love to which they have no right&mdash;a love that is another&#39;s!
May success but open the gates of sorrow; may that which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
they desired and schemed to gain crush the heart, even
in its triumph, down to the very dust! Deal out stern
justice, untempered by all mercy, to the false, the scornful,
the treacherous, the hypocritical, to those who are unscrupulous
and base in thy service, and who cast aside all
honour when in pursuit of that which thou dost offer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she stood silent awhile, still gazing with fixed
eyes at the impassive countenance before her, monstrous,
yet so strangely human. She had not originally designed
to send forth such a plea into the universe, but it had
arisen spontaneously from the depth of her soul, and she
would not have recalled one word.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she turned, and slowly, with strange reluctance
proceeded to quit this dim sanctuary. Still her mind was
not relieved. Impulsively she hastened back and stood
close under the grim black statue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sekhet,&quot; she whispered softly and rapidly, &quot;help me&mdash;help
me always. Whatever be the price of your aid I will
pay it ungrudgingly. Watch over me; be ever near me.
I cannot live without love. I do not shrink from its
suffering. Sekhet, at all costs, I am thy worshipper. Do
not forsake me. Do not forsake me ever.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the throat of her gown were fastened a couple of
crimson roses. They drooped now after the long day,
yet were still rich in perfume. These she unclasped and
laid on the yellow sand at the base of the statue. Then,
with a final glance around the little chamber&mdash;once well
accustomed to the sound of prayer, now but the relic of a
dead religion&mdash;she hurried away.</p>

<h2><a name="chXI" id="chXI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<small>A LOSING STRIFE</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Evarne</span> radiated with delight and relief when this
Nile cruise came to an end. She could not avoid
the mortifying conviction that she had proved
herself very childish and incompetent in having
allowed a state of affairs so painful&mdash;let alone dangerous to
herself and her future&mdash;to have come to pass, and to continue.
Lucinda, ignorant as a kitten on Egyptology and
all kindred subjects, had been wont to wax enthusiastic
over what she appeared to consider Evarne&#39;s quite superhuman
fund of knowledge and marvellous intelligence,
as contrasted with her own much-lamented but unconquerable
silliness. Yet the girl guessed shrewdly that had
the situations been reversed, the frivolous, empty-headed
Lucinda, so given to harping on the topic of her own incompetence,
would have proved an infinitely more resourceful
and successful tactician.</p>

<p class="indent">Delightful indeed was it to see the last of the Belmonts&mdash;both
so objectionable in their respective ways&mdash;and when
she found herself once again alone with Morris at &quot;Mon
Bijou,&quot; she was gay and light-hearted as any child in her
renewed happiness. Florelli&#39;s studio saw her not. She
devoted her whole time to Morris, as bright, appreciative
and amusing a little comrade as man could wish.</p>

<p class="indent">But, alack and alas! this sojourn in the oasis of contentment
was destined to be but brief. One morning, not
long after their return, as they sat at breakfast on the
verandah, Bianca entered with the post. No letters ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
came for Evarne save bills, which she always passed straight
over to Morris; but this time her name appeared on the
face of a delicate pink envelope. On the back were the
initials &quot;L. B.,&quot; intertwined into a large and involved
gold monogram.</p>

<p class="indent">The whole thing was highly perfumed, and its recipient
sniffed with exaggerated disdain even before she had
opened the envelope and mastered its contents. When
she had done that she looked up in genuine indignation as
she murmured, &quot;The impertinence of the woman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris, who had been watching her, now reached over
for the letter, and likewise perused the &quot;impertinence.&quot;
It apparently did not strike him in the same light, for, as
he laid it down, a meditative grunt of approval accompanied
the action.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think we will accept,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no, no&mdash;impossible!&quot; was Evarne&#39;s instantaneous
and startled response.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter that had created such emphatic difference of
opinion ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dearest Evarne</span> (for so I always think of you),&mdash;Absence
makes the heart grow fonder, so they say, and I
find it true that it wasn&#39;t until the radiant time on &#39;The
Radiant Isis&#39; was over that I realised how very attached
I&#39;d become to you, dear. I do hope we shall mature our
friendship begun under such delightful auspices, so I am
writing to ask you if you will become my guest in Paris for
some weeks. Do come, dear; I am so looking forward
to seeing you again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m well aware when I ask this that Mr. Kenyon is the
fair Evarne&#39;s devoted shadow, and I mustn&#39;t dare to enjoy
the sweet charm of the rose without its accompanying
thorn (of course that is quite between ourselves, dear);
but Tony is writing to him, for he has promised (dear
fellow!) to take Mr. Kenyon off on long masculine jaunts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
(and we won&#39;t inquire too deeply where they go, will we,
dear?) while you and I are enjoying the Paris shops and
other feminine frivolities in one another&#39;s society to our
heart&#39;s content.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am looking forward to a most enjoyable time, darling
Evarne.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="author">&quot;<span class="smcap">Lucinda Belmont</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;P.S.&mdash;We shall be both getting our new season&#39;s &#39;rigs-out,&#39;
shan&#39;t we? I know of such a heavenly place for
hats.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, indeed, I don&#39;t want to go! I should hate it. I
can&#39;t bear either Mr. or Mrs. Belmont,&quot; cried Evarne, after
a silence long enough to show only too plainly that Morris
was not going to readily yield to her desires in the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">On the contrary, he proceeded to argue. At her age
she ought not to seek to bury herself in the solitude of
studios or a villa remote from the centres of civilisation.
She owed it to herself to be seen and admired. She must
go more amongst people, and the companionship of a
good-natured, clever woman of the world&mdash;such as was
Mrs. Belmont&mdash;would be of vast benefit to her in every
way.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl retorted that she had no objection to the centres
of civilisation as such, nor to meeting as many of Morris&#39;s
friends as he wished, but that she would not visit Mrs.
Belmont, with whom she had not a taste or a thought in
common; who was, in fact, a person entirely and absolutely
hateful in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice quite quivered with apprehensive distress,
but when Morris proceeded to speak on Lucinda&#39;s behalf,
lauding her tact and worldly knowledge, Evarne rose in
indignant wrath.</p>

<p class="indent">If those were the qualities that were characteristic of
Mrs. Belmont, then, for her part, she hoped never to become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
tainted by their possession. &quot;But,&quot; she declared, &quot;without
being either as tactful, or as wise, or as experienced
as that middle-aged designing creature, I&#39;m not quite the
abject fool she seems to take me for. She need not think
that her sickening show of affection towards me has ever
deceived me one jot. I put up with it and her in Egypt
because I couldn&#39;t help myself, but I&#39;m not going to her
house, and you can write and tell her so, for I shan&#39;t even
answer her hateful, hypocritical letter; so there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having delivered herself of this ultimatum, she flung
her serviette on the table and swept away, heedlessly
dragging over her chair with the train of her morning
gown. Morris gazed in amazement at her empty place.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the first serious clash of wills that had ever risen
between the girl and her lover. The dispute was ardent
and protracted, but very soon it became evident that both
her coaxing and her resolutions were equally vain when
opposed to his wishes. While ostentatiously leaving her
perfect freedom of choice for herself, he was going to
Paris!</p>

<p class="indent">So, with the utmost reluctance and a considerable sense
of humiliation, Evarne submitted as gracefully as might
be. She could not bring herself to so far cherish her
dignity as to remain haughtily alone at &quot;Mon Bijou,&quot;
knowing Morris to be once more within the range of the
wiles and allurements of a clever and unscrupulous <i>demi-mondaine</i>.
Although she believed that, up to the present,
she still retained her sway upon his affections, his own
teachings led her not to place too confiding a reliance upon
the Joseph-like qualities of the most devoted of lovers.</p>

<p class="indent">Never before had she bade adieu to her beautiful brilliant
room with such a heavy heart. She stood in the doorway,
gazing longingly around, imprinting every corner, every
contrast of colour, freshly upon her memory. How happy
she had been at &quot;Mon Bijou&quot;! How dear it all was to
her!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
Both common-sense and diplomacy prompted her to
greet Lucinda with smiling, albeit somewhat stiff, cordiality,
and she effectively concealed her scorn when her hostess,
gushingly embracing her, put her face close up to hers and
made a hasty little smacking sound into the air, first on
one side, then on the other&mdash;Lucinda&#39;s only conception
of how to kiss another woman.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris had given Evarne a cheque-book, and opened a
generous account for her at his bank, and for the first few
days the programme promised in the invitation was carried
out to the letter. He and Tony did, in fact, derive whatever
satisfaction and benefit was to be gained from one
another&#39;s society, while their female belongings amused
themselves together by shopping and such-like diversions.
The girl could not but acknowledge that Lucinda&#39;s vivacity
and bright flow of talk were far from unamusing, yet to
recognise the efficiency of the weapons of one whom she
felt to be her remorseless foe did not at all ease her mind
or soften her reciprocal feelings of enmity.</p>

<p class="indent">Very soon the foreseen change came to pass.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s absolutely stupid to have nice men on hand if
one is to see nothing of them. One might just as well be
a miserable Egyptian woman right away,&quot; announced
Lucinda, and none could contradict her words. &quot;It&#39;s too
mean of me to bore dear Evarne by keeping her all to my
dull self,&quot; was her next statement. And so the divided
expeditions of the party ceased, and then it was not long
ere the old miserable state of affairs that had ruined the
cruise of &quot;The Radiant Isis&quot; was again in full swing.</p>

<p class="indent">But even this was not enough. Next came the suggestion
that <i>tête-à-tête</i> expeditions were, after all, better.
Lucinda was sure that, as Evarne was so clever, and an
artist too, she, of course, must want to go round the
galleries and see the statues and such-like things. Lucinda
herself was so very silly she couldn&#39;t appreciate old masters
one bit. Then she got such dreadful headaches in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
close atmosphere. It must be lovely to be strong just like
a man, as dear Evarne was, but for her part she got utterly
exhausted in half an hour. Really, she must reluctantly
relinquish these delightful expeditions to dear Tony.
Tony had quite gone off his head lately; he had actually
taken to trying to improve his mind. She couldn&#39;t imagine
why! As if dear Tony wasn&#39;t quite clever enough as it
was for a silly, frivolous little woman like herself, who
only cared for chiffons. Perhaps it was the beneficial
result of Evarne&#39;s society on board &quot;The Radiant Isis.&quot;
She only wished she was half as clever as dear Evarne;
cultivated women acquired such a good influence over men&mdash;so
much more powerful and lasting than silly, frivolous
creatures like herself could ever hope to gain.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne hated her! Hated her for her gibes, her scarce-concealed
mockery, and, above all, she loathed her for the
sarcastic flattery and never-failing show of affection under
which thin veil she sought to cover her intention of stealing
the girl&#39;s rich lover, if she could encompass that act. It
was a method that made retort difficult; and, moreover,
Evarne was under the disadvantage of still retaining her
over-sensitive self-respect. It was revolting to her to
openly admit that she was engaged in a vulgar struggle
with another woman&mdash;and a woman so far beneath herself&mdash;for
the possession of a man.</p>

<p class="indent">Now she said simply and frankly that her interest in
museums had always depended entirely upon Morris&#39;s
society, and that without him such things did not appeal
to her much. But, far from pleased by this statement,
he frowned darkly, spoke of neglected opportunities, and
discourtesy to her host. Finally he acknowledged that&mdash;relying
upon her being otherwise pleasantly occupied&mdash;he
had arranged to take Mrs. Belmont for some expeditions
in a certain swift motor-car that only accommodated two.
Thus, short of creating a scene, the girl found herself
faced by the alternatives of remaining alone in the flat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
obviously sulking, or endeavouring to cover her defeat by
accepting Tony&#39;s eager escort and pretending to enjoy
visiting the antiquities and art treasures in the Louvre.</p>

<p class="indent">She had already implored Morris to leave Paris, but he
had turned a deaf ear to her appeal. Now, although she
managed to smile at Tony and to declare, gaily enough,
her willingness to further encourage him in improving his
mind together with her own, she was torn by agony of
spirit at this new proof of her beloved&#39;s rapidly maturing
infatuation for her rival.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, it all had the advantage of preventing
the final blow from falling as a bolt from the blue. Nor
was the hour far off.</p>

<h2><a name="chXII" id="chXII"></a>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>SEKHET, CRUSHER OF HEARTS</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">One</span> morning, weary and depressed after a wakeful
night, her determination had faltered at the
very moment of setting out on an expedition
with Tony as sole escort. With her foot actually
on the step of the carriage she had suddenly informed
him, somewhat curtly, that he really must amuse himself
that day, returning and shutting herself in her room, deaf
to all expostulations.</p>

<p class="indent">Tony, decidedly chagrined, had loitered for a while in
the lonely flat&mdash;teased the dog&mdash;flirted with one of the
maid-servants&mdash;and had finally taken his departure.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne sat on in solitude, alternately striving to read a
novel and freely permitting her tortured imagination to
dwell on the vision of Morris and Lucinda being whirled
happily together through the fresh country lanes.</p>

<p class="indent">A few hours later, hearing a footstep and the sound of
the opening front door, and wishing now to make peace
with Tony before the others returned and troubled her
with &quot;whys&quot; and &quot;wherefores,&quot; she went to the drawing-room,
prepared to be very sweet and amiable. But the
footsteps had not been those of her host. It was the
motoring couple who had returned thus early.</p>

<p class="indent">Lucinda, vivacious as usual, had already removed her
hat and veil, and was drawing off her long gloves. She
worked industriously at the fingers of one hand until she
had drawn a loose end of the white kid forward over each
finger-tip then suddenly called upon Morris.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m impatient. I can&#39;t tear these things off. You
had better come to the rescue.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gathering up the already loose ends between his thumb
and finger, Morris took hold of her other hand also, and
suddenly jerked both her arms forcibly over his shoulders.
As she unavoidably fell forward on his breast he encircled
her waist and kissed the laughing face so near to his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s none like you, you damned little witch,&quot; he
declared.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne had not desired to be an eavesdropper, and had
no thought of concealing her presence now. She still held
in her hand the book she had been reading, and, with a sharp
indrawing of her breath, announced her presence by violently
flinging the volume to the ground with a loud bang.</p>

<p class="indent">Seeing her, Lucinda uttered a scream and fled. Morris
remained without moving, gazing at the girl with the
utmost nonchalance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve precipitated matters, Evarne,&quot; he said calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">Her first outburst of anger was directed against Lucinda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s nothing in all this world that is more utterly
despicable and hateful and detestable, more altogether
vile, than to pretend a friendship for a woman in order
to get chances to steal her lover!&quot; she cried, with sufficient
energy to suggest that she was directing her opinion through
the closed door that Lucinda had banged after her in her
hurried flight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All&#39;s fair in love and war,&quot; retorted Morris.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a lie,&quot; was the startlingly frank answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it? Then what about you and Tony?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tony Belmont? Be careful, Morris! What about
us? That creature, seeing something more to her taste
in you, has flung her cast-off lover at my head. He has
played into her hands readily enough, and you have stood
by and seen it being done. How dare you then ask such
a question?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you may choose to look at it in that light, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
the fact remains unaltered and undeniable that Tony
practically deserted Lucinda from the time he first saw
you, and you didn&#39;t care one jot what suffering it caused
that poor little woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor defenceless little darling!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words were spoken with bitter sarcasm, while the
fiery indignation already surging within the girl&#39;s breast
increased tenfold beneath this amazing accusation&mdash;this
unscrupulous falsifying of the truth. There was a
moment&#39;s silence, then her words rang out with passionate
force&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the arch hypocrisy! Liars, both of you&mdash;abject
liars&mdash;trying to make excuses for your own foul treachery!
It&#39;s sickening! I shan&#39;t stay another night&mdash;no, not
another hour&mdash;beneath her roof.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is Tony&#39;s roof, and you had better remain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t, I won&#39;t! How can you even suggest such a
thing? I can&#39;t breathe the same air that she does. It&#39;s
poisonous&mdash;contaminated!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gently, gently; you&#39;ll be overheard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rubbish! I don&#39;t care! I won&#39;t be gentle. What
do you mean by defending her? What is she to
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And the verbal refusal to be gentle was confirmed by a
violent blow on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris, albeit decidedly surprised, answered with unruffled
suavity. He was quite willing to make allowances
for this natural anger and show of indignation; at the
same time the wondrous patience the girl had exhibited
hitherto had given him little cause to anticipate the tempestuous
quality of her aroused wrath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is your philosophy all culled from antique authors,
sweet student? Have you never found time to peep into
Darwin and assimilate the doctrine of the Survival of the
Fittest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s that to do&mdash;&mdash;?&quot; she cried in bewilderment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
not seeing at first any connection between her question
and this answer. Yet even as she spoke came a sudden
mental illumination of his meaning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Morris, you can&#39;t mean to say you really do prefer
that vulgar, coarse-minded, spiteful, abandoned creature
to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;Oh Heaven!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She brushed her hair roughly back from her forehead,
and stared at him fixedly, her big eyes still full of incredulity.
Then she uttered a brief laugh of mingled bitterness
and disdain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there! From a man&#39;s point of view, I suppose
the Fittest always and only implies the Newest. Despicable
wretches, the whole lot of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris, amused at this sweeping statement, smiled as
he answered&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it&#39;s a little weakness that is no ways confined
to mere man. It isn&#39;t only to us that constancy spells
boredom. It&#39;s all very well for middle-aged women, who
feel their power of pleasing on the wane, to cling like
limpets. We expect it, and it&#39;s one reason why wise men
avoid &#39;em. It always means beastly rows in the long run.
But, thank goodness, at your time of life, my child, variety
is charming, even to the fair sex.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The latter portion of these sentiments fell unheeded&mdash;practically
unheard. All the girl&#39;s thoughts and senses
were concentrated upon her own agony of spirit. Fully
grasping now, for the very first time, that Morris&#39;s defection
was serious and deliberate, all indignation and resentment
were swamped by a wave of wild grief and horror before
which all else broke down. When she could speak it
was only in disjointed sentences, in a voice that quivered
under stress of emotion and struggled with choking
sobs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, oh! Can I only bore you now by loving you?
You can&#39;t mean that. Not really and truly. I can&#39;t
have lost your love so utterly. What have I ever done?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
Oh, Morris, what have I done? I&#39;ve never altered to you,
and I never would. I would always be faithful to you&mdash;always.
Is it a curse to have a faithful heart? I can&#39;t
stop caring for you, because you tell me to; how&mdash;how
can I? Are you really altogether tired of me? I knew
men did get tired, easily, cruelly easily, but somehow&mdash;&mdash;Perhaps
if I&#39;d been different? Oh, I did try! I did,
always! I did! But there, I&#39;ve been so utterly miserable
lately, it&#39;s better really to know the truth straight out at
once. Tell me the truth, Morris.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you know it, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me, tell me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now what is the good of upsetting yourself like this?
Come, come!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re going to give that&mdash;that woman&mdash;my place!
Oh! you&#39;ll be sorry. She&#39;s only selfish and mercenary.
She doesn&#39;t love you, and I do. You&mdash;you don&#39;t care
for that, though. Oh, how can you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris was feeling awkwardly uncomfortable. He took
a flower from a vase, and put it in his buttonhole before
he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m perfectly aware,&quot; he confessed at length, &quot;that
in the abstract Lucinda is neither so handsome, so brilliant,
nor so really delightful as you are, but still&mdash;still&mdash;&mdash;&quot; He
paused. &quot;There, I&#39;m not worth bothering about, so
dry your eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By a powerful effort of self-command she managed to
regain some degree of composure, and to steady her voice.
Quite quietly she repeated his words, &quot;not worth bothering
about,&quot; then, after an interval, &quot;Ah, me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The tender yearning tone in which this little exclamation
came was fraught with significance. After another moment&#39;s
thought she approached quite close to him, and
rested the tips of her fingers upon his chest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid you <i>are</i> worth bothering about, my dear,&quot;
she went on, making a rather pitiful little attempt to hide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
her sick anxiety by pretending to smile. Then, after a
somewhat protracted pause, she spoke again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I&mdash;there, why should I be ashamed to say it again,
even now? I love you still&mdash;oh, so much! I&#39;m sure I
shall always love you. I can&#39;t help it. We can&#39;t arrange
our feelings so that they shall always be convenient and
suitable. It was never really right that we should care
for one another at all, because&mdash;because of your wife,
and I would never&mdash;no never&mdash;have taken her place if
you had even so much as hinted that you might one day
come to look upon it as something merely temporary;
something that could be lightly set aside as soon as you
met another woman whom you&mdash;liked a bit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, don&#39;t speak, Morris! I haven&#39;t done yet. You
know full well that though I loved you, oh! so dearly,
I never wanted to lead any other than what I thought
was a perfectly honourable life. You know you didn&#39;t
win me easily, in spite of everything being in your favour.
You told me that because you had made a mistake in your
marriage you were lonely and unhappy, and that, though
you couldn&#39;t make me really your wife, our union should be
as lasting and sacred as any legal bond. It was to be your
true marriage. You&#39;re not treating me fairly now, dear,
you&#39;re not really. You ought to feel really more tied to me
by honour and loyalty than you would do even if I were
indeed your wife, and had not lost my good name for your
sake. I&#39;ve never been troublesome and jealous, you can&#39;t
say that, and when you found you were getting&mdash;well,
seriously attached to another woman, it&#39;s not a bit unreasonable
of me to think you ought to have avoided seeing
her again. You owed it to me to be true always&mdash;you did,
indeed. You knew I was not like Mrs. Belmont, who
treats these ties so lightly. Come away now, darling&mdash;come
away from Paris. She can&#39;t really have won your
heart yet&mdash;only your fancy, only your passing fancy,
Morris. You would soon forget her. Come away with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
me, and we will be so happy together again, and honest
and upright and without any cause to be ashamed, either
of us. Do come, darling&mdash;do, do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her arms were tightly clasped around his neck, and her
wistful, eager face&mdash;the piteous brown eyes moist and
beseeching&mdash;were close to his. But beauty that has palled
no longer possesses power. Sentimental appeals to honour
and loyalty were very troublesome; while the reference
to an imaginary link that was to be held binding upon him
for evermore was merely vexing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re a good, sweet little soul,&quot; he said, rather testily,
unclasping her arms&mdash;&quot;no one knows that better than I
do&mdash;and I should have supposed, therefore, that you would
be the last to suggest that we should continue our life
together without mutual love. On the contrary, a woman
of your moral excellence ought not to be willing to consent
to such a proceeding. And, what&#39;s more, you mustn&#39;t
blame me, you know. Remember your own wise words,
&#39;We can&#39;t arrange our feelings, our affections, according to
what would be, perhaps, the most conducive to a quiet
life.&#39; We may all be but the sport of the gods, but let&#39;s
go on strike against taking part in any tragedies for the
entertainment of the higher powers. Let&#39;s insist on being
merely comedians. We will say good-bye smilingly, and
thus snap our fingers at Fate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne twisted her hands together helplessly. She
had much to say, so much, but further speech was beyond
her power.</p>

<p class="indent">Her throat swelled, she bit the inside of her lower lip
pitilessly to stay its quivering, but was scarcely conscious
of the tears that poured down her cheeks unheeded. After
a minute&#39;s futile struggle to retain some show of self-command,
she moved away a step or two, sank into an armchair,
buried her face in the cushions, and sobbed without
restraint.</p>

<p class="indent">A tumultuous medley of wild impassioned ideas surged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
within her brain, incomplete thoughts, disconnected and
rapidly cast aside. But, amid them all, were none urging
calm submission, dignified resignation. On the contrary,
all alike were directed on evolving some method of warding
off this unendurable blow&mdash;or, at least, since it had fallen,
of nullifying its effects.</p>

<p class="indent">The thing seemed so incredible, unreal, impossible, the
end of all life. She resolutely declined to admit that
there was nothing whatsoever to be done; she could not
consent to allow all hope to leave her. And yet&mdash;yet&mdash;immovable
and grim, the bedrock underlying these wild
surgings of despised and deserted love, was the conviction
that her richest store of eloquence, the whole of her most
intense and protracted efforts, would prove powerless to
alter the inevitable. Distracted, tortured, she gasped between
her sobs&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall kill myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris was just in the act of stealing softly from the
room. Looking rather foolish, he turned sharply, and
crossed over to her side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tut, tut! You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re saying now,
you&#39;re talking wildly,&quot; he declared soothingly. &quot;You
really mustn&#39;t take things so to heart. You&#39;ll make yourself
quite ill. Go and lie down quietly, and I&#39;ll send
Bianca in to you with a cup of tea.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying, but I know
that I&#39;m not saying half I feel,&quot; she declared truthfully
enough. Then, after a moment&#39;s further reflection, her
momentary composure again gave way. &quot;Oh, how could
you make me love you, only to treat me like this? It
was cruel, brutal! How can I bear it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris patted her shoulder encouragingly, but remained
silent. He had been through a few tempestuous scenes
ere this, and knowing that a man did not shine on such
occasions, was resigned to looking and feeling foolish while
it lasted, devoting his efforts chiefly to getting the <i>mauvais</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
<i>quart d&#39;heure</i> over as quietly as possible. For this, his one
theory lay in the proverb, &quot;Least said, soonest mended.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne put out her hand and pushed him away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t do that&mdash;don&#39;t! You know you hate me now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again Morris smiled; women always went to such
extremes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bless you, not a bit of it! Why, I hope we are going
to part the best of friends,&quot; was his lightly spoken disavowal
of this accusation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To part!&quot; murmured Evarne, after him, monotonously&mdash;&quot;to
part!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then suddenly an inward voice seemed to commence
repeating over and over again, &quot;There is nothing so dead
as a dead love. There is nothing so dead as a dead love.
Nothing so dead, nothing, nothing!&quot; It was maddening.
The unhesitating certainty&mdash;the calm conviction animating
the phrase&mdash;brought final despair. In it she heard a call,
inspired by the wisdom of ages, the outcome of the most
bitter experience of long generations of mankind; a call
to abandon efforts that were predestined to be sterile.
It was as if she were abruptly faced by the inscription that
Dante read over the gateways of hell. Sitting erect, she
lifted her voice in lamentation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Morris, darling, you can&#39;t change so utterly.
You&#39;re the same man. I&#39;m still the same woman. How
many times did you swear you would love me always and
ever&mdash;always and ever&mdash;and now I&#39;m only just twenty!&quot;
she wailed, catching at his arm and pressing her cheek to
his coat-sleeve, while her sobs grew louder and more
convulsive.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris, already wearied, felt a tiny twinge of compunction,
and was thereupon easily moved to anger by her
impassioned weeping.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For goodness&#39; sake, Evarne, do let us have an end to
this ridiculous scene,&quot; he said roughly, shaking himself
free from her despairing hold. &quot;Do recognise the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
that not all the pleading in the world will have any effect
on me. If you don&#39;t pull yourself together you&#39;ll have
hysterics in a moment, and I&#39;ve no patience with hysterical
women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The action, the cruel words themselves, and the tone
in which they were uttered, combined to goad the girl to
sudden wrath. She sprang to her feet, and without a
moment&#39;s hesitation frantically struck him on the chest
with her clenched fist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t think I shall ask anything of you now&mdash;no, not
so much as your patience,&quot; she cried. &quot;I don&#39;t intend to
plead with any man for his love, least of all with you&mdash;don&#39;t
think it! I never want to see you again, never!
Go to Mrs. Belmont&mdash;go and make her your mistress.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris allowed himself to be thoroughly angered by the
blow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thanks for the permission,&quot; he said curtly; &quot;but it
happens to be quite unnecessary, as we have not waited
for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He now anticipated being deluged beneath a torrent of
words, but though her lips parted, Evarne stood quite
speechless, only blinking her eyes a little, as if bewildered
and dazed. Then she slowly retreated backwards across
the room step by step, until she was brought to a standstill
by reaching the china cabinet. Leaning against it, she
turned her head from side to side for a minute or two,
then, producing a flimsy, ineffectual little handkerchief,
proceeded, with strange, unlooked-for composure, to wipe
her eyes and tear-stained cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So now you see you may just as well be sensible and
resigned, eh?&quot; suggested Morris, with forced carelessness.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne made no sign of having heard, but continued
her touching little occupation. The protracted silence
became embarrassing. Morris was haunted by the fear
that this apparently delightful calm must be but ominous
and deceptive.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ll make different arrangements by to-morrow,&quot; he
continued at length, in a business-like tone. &quot;I can
understand you don&#39;t care to be in the same place. I ought
not to have allowed it. I apologise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still silence. He was just about to speak again, when
Evarne announced in tones of quiet conviction, seemingly
to herself, &quot;I must get away from this house at once&mdash;at
once!&quot; and walked towards the door as if about to
suit the action to the words without any delay.</p>

<p class="indent">But Morris hurried over to prevent the fulfilment of this
impulse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Believe me,&quot; he assured her, retaining his grasp of the
door-handle, &quot;there is some one who would rather that
all the rest of us should slip over the fourth dimension
than have you undertake the <i>rôle</i> of vanishing lady. Darwin
applies all round, remember, and to Tony&#39;s way of
thinking you are the fittest in all the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A dangerous gleam darted into the girl&#39;s eyes, and she
stamped her foot passionately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How dare you offer me such an insult? Haven&#39;t
you done enough yet to make yourself hateful to me?
Have you no shame whatsoever? Be silent, I tell you&mdash;be
silent!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a gesture of despair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of all the unreasonable people! Now, why should
listening to a simple statement of facts cause you to get
into such a temper?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why?&mdash;why, indeed! You can&#39;t see; oh dear no, it&#39;s
quite beyond your comprehension, isn&#39;t it? Learn this,
then: though you have made me a more degraded creature
than I ever before realised, you haven&#39;t killed all my soul,
neither shall you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Souls at this moment! Good gracious, my dear girl,
I only wish I had made you a bit more practical. But
there, I fear you&#39;re utterly incorrigible. Poor old Tony
mayn&#39;t be quite your ideal knight, but do try to realise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
that while sugar-icing forms a charming coating for a cake,
the cake is just as sustaining without it. Are you positively
so blinded by silly sentimentality as to be really incapable
of seeing any cause for congratulation in the lucky chance
that has led him to take a fancy to you? A good-hearted
fellow with plenty of money. What more can you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Anger had found small place in the girl&#39;s breast while
she was being made to realise the dread truth that her
lover was finally weary of her and of her affection; nor
had even lasting indignation awoken until he taunted her
with the display of bitter grief that this very knowledge
had evoked. When he thus persisted in what she could but
deem the last of insults&mdash;this determination to regard her
only as a light toy, to be tossed from one man to another&mdash;then
the capacity for wild wrath that she derived from her
violent low-born mother, and a long line of fiery-tempered
maternal ancestors, showed itself in all its power.</p>

<p class="indent">Up to the present her own personal gentleness of spirit,
aided by the trend of her education, and the affection
by which she had always been encircled, had sufficed to
keep even the girl herself in ignorance of the capacity
that lay dormant in her blood for feeling and displaying
wild fury. Now, in circumstances provocative of wrath
such as had never yet occurred in the whole range of her
limited experience, she became entirely her mother&#39;s
daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If ever again I touch a farthing of such money may I
fall down dead!&quot; she cried wildly. &quot;That&#39;s my only
answer. Oh! It&#39;s the devil gives money to men of your
stamp, so that you may with more certainty work out
your own damnation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not be melodramatic,&quot; implored Morris, giving
each word its full value to render it more impressive,
while he shook his head, and screwed up his face in superior
disdain. &quot;Of course&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want&mdash;I refuse, absolutely refuse to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
anything more you&#39;ve got to say; so you may as well hold
your tongue,&quot; interrupted Evarne fiercely. &quot;Get out of
the way; stand aside from the door; let me get out of
this room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Morris did not move.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not so, you&#39;re far too excited. There&#39;s no knowing
what you might do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He made a great mistake in preventing her from finding
the solitude she instinctively sought. His words and
presence were unendurably exasperating at this juncture.</p>

<p class="indent">She sat down on a couch, and tapped the floor impatiently
with the toe of her velvet slipper.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris tried again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you could only persuade yourself to look at the
matter clearly&mdash;&quot; But he broke off abruptly. Evarne
had merely raised her head and looked at him, but that
was all-sufficient. &quot;It&#39;s evidently no use talking sense to
anyone so beside herself as you are now,&quot; he concluded
lamely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No use, so let me pass.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sprang to her feet, and came close to him. Her
face was flushed, while her eyes seemed to fairly blaze
with passion; every breath she drew was distinctly audible.
It really spoke something for Morris&#39;s strength of mind
that he stood his ground.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not until you&#39;re calmer,&quot; he insisted.</p>

<p class="indent">Her lips set themselves into a firm line, and for a moment
she appeared to be contemplating the employment of
physical force to gain her will, but apparently she thought
better of it, for, quite suddenly sweeping over to the
opposite side of the room, she turned her back on Morris
and leant both elbows on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know that Tony&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he recommenced, somewhat
unwisely; then changed his sentence: &quot;If you would but
believe that I am only considering your best
advantage&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Believe you?&mdash;never again Liar! Abject liar!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
Morris was thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, look here, what do you suppose it matters to me
what you do now?&quot; he demanded fiercely. &quot;I could
more than discharge all my obligations to you by a final
cheque, and I don&#39;t want any further show of ingratitude
if I give you also the benefit of my advice. I tell you, a
young woman of your personal charms needs not only
money but a protector. However, please yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne turned sharply, and again broke in upon him
before the words were well out of his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you want to drive me mad?&quot; she shouted. &quot;I
hate you, I loathe you, I despise you! Oh, if some one
would only protect me now from you, you coward!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The veins stood up on the man&#39;s temples.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s difficult to see why you persist in going on like
a fool, and trying to deceive me. I&#39;m perfectly convinced
that, whatever the price demanded you will no more be
found living without luxuries in the future than you have
in the past, so why indulge in these absurd airs and graces
of outraged virtue?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment everything whirled before Evarne&#39;s eyes;
then, incapable of remaining without action, she commenced
to pace up and down the room. A little table on
which stood photograph frames, a vase of lilac, and various
similar knick-knacks, stood in her path. Without a
moment&#39;s hesitation she flung it aside, scattering the
dainty ornaments in all directions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s foolish to be angry with you,&quot; said Morris, suddenly
calming himself. &quot;You are clearly not responsible for
what you do or say. You must go to your room and lie
down. Do you hear? I insist. It would serve you right
if I did leave you to your own devices entirely, but you are
so young and silly that for your father&#39;s sake I&#39;m going
to see your future settled somehow, whether you say
&#39;thank you&#39; or not. Now come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you dare to touch me!&quot; screamed the girl.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
&quot;You&#39;ve no right now to interfere with my life, and you
shan&#39;t do it. How dare you speak of my father, when
you&#39;ve so brutally betrayed his trust? You&#39;ve lied, and
tricked, and ruined me. I suppose you can&#39;t help being
so ignoble and contemptible that loyalty and faith are
only objects of derision to you; but that you should be
willing&mdash;anxious&mdash;to pass me on to a despicable rake&mdash;not
so vile as yourself, but still vile&mdash;that I shall never
forget and never forgive, and, if I can help it, God likewise
shall never forgive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a ridiculous position to take up! Do you
really expect to be ever anything more than one upon a
string of beads? You knew you hadn&#39;t been otherwise
with me, and you never will be now with any other man&mdash;so
you may as well make up your mind to it, and think
yourself lucky if&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl, distracted and infuriated, waited for no more.
Snatching up a silver statuette she hurled it with all her
force at her betrayer&#39;s head. Then for a time she knew
nothing; all was a blank&mdash;devoid of memory&mdash;of thought&mdash;of
consciousness of action. Quite suddenly she seemed
to regain her senses&mdash;to awake to find herself alone&mdash;the
carpet covered with fragments of broken glass, streams of
water, disordered flowers, books, scattered ornaments,
while she herself was throwing madly, fiercely, everything
on which she could lay hands, smash against the closed
door by which Morris had been standing.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXIII" id="chXIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<small>OUT OF THE GILDED CAGE</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Instantly</span> subdued by amazement, she stared
aghast at the surrounding destruction. At the
dread realisation that she was beholding the work
of her own hands, a shrinking horror&mdash;a terrible
fear of herself&mdash;filled her breast. Why, in very sooth, this
looked like the doings of a madwoman, and she had known
nothing of what she was about. What could it portend?
Trembling violently, she leant against the wall, scarcely
able to stand, her hands pressing her cheeks, her eyes dilated
and glancing around as if in apprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">How blessed just at that moment would have been the
care of her mother&mdash;or, indeed, of any tender woman.
But she was quite alone&mdash;or worse than that, surrounded
only by those who had reduced her to this state, and by
servants filled with curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent">After an interval of quietness the door was cautiously
opened a trifle, a head was popped in and rapidly withdrawn.
Evarne had not time to notice to whom it belonged,
but she immediately regained sufficient strength
to walk across the room. She could not endure to be thus
made into a spectacle, neither could she longer gaze upon
this dire material destruction that typified, only too
cruelly, the fate that had befallen her love, her happiness
and her future.</p>

<p class="indent">As she opened the door and appeared on the threshold,
there was a general sense of rustling, of rapid footsteps,
of stifled exclamations in the corridor and the surrounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
rooms, as various figures hastened to efface themselves.
But the girl, heeding nothing, made directly for her own
apartment and securely locked herself therein.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, after a moment&#39;s reflection on what had passed
that hour, she again collapsed beneath alternate transports
of anger and heart-tearing grief. Now she would be sweeping
wildly to and fro, with clenched fists and hurried
strides, her body swaying and shaking as she walked;
next, exhausted, flinging herself upon bed or floor, torn
with sobs, drowned by tears, only to spring to her feet
again as stress of anguish goaded her to action.</p>

<p class="indent">Her feelings towards Morris were variable as the wind.
At times the memory of his brutal insults, his treachery
and faithlessness, were uppermost in her thoughts; then
she felt for him only the most intense and passionate hatred,
bitterly grudging every hour of happiness to which she
had contributed in the past; praying wildly that the
future might hold for him agony of spirit equal to that into
which he had so ruthlessly plunged her. Then, again, a
flood of her old devotion would rise above all else. &quot;Morris,
Morris, come back to me! Oh, my darling, my darling,
how can I live without you?&quot; was her sobbing appeal;
but there was none to answer.</p>

<p class="indent">For the most part she sorrowed in silence. She was
aware that whispered conversations were in progress outside
her door, and more than once the handle was turned
cautiously. Later in the afternoon, Bianca, who was
genuinely attached to her beautiful young mistress, ventured
to tap again and again, at the same time imploring,
in a tremulous voice, to be allowed to do something&mdash;anything.
But Evarne turned a deaf ear to all.</p>

<p class="indent">Time passed, and the first violence of her emotion
burned itself out. Then she became conscious that she
felt sick and ill, and that her head ached to distraction.
Letting down her thick black hair, she threw herself once
again upon her tumbled bed, and made a first serious and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
protracted effort to remain absolutely quiet and calm.
Long she lay there, staring at vacancy, sighing piteously
at intervals, until as the evening twilight crept into the
room, the lids drooped over the wild eyes and the exhausted
girl sank into slumber.</p>

<p class="indent">When she awoke, it was night. The room was shrouded
in darkness, and perfect silence reigned. As recollection
returned she despairingly pressed her hands to her head,
but firmly forbade any further lapse from self-control.
The determination she had arrived at during the weary
time she had lain passive before falling asleep was now to
be put into action. When the traitors who were beneath
that roof awoke in the morning, they should find their
victim gone. She shrank from again meeting either of
the Belmonts; Morris it was better she should not see.
One of the trains that left Paris in the grey of the morning
should bear her away&mdash;far beyond the reach of these, her
enemies.</p>

<p class="indent">Her thoughts turned towards London. She was not
exactly a feminine Dick Whittington; at the same time
the great metropolis certainly seemed to offer the greatest
hope for one who had her own way to make.</p>

<p class="indent">Flashing on the light, she looked at her watch. It was a
quarter-past three. She rose up, and drawing the curtains
over the windows, set about packing the few things it was
imperative she should take. At first she seemed to possess
neither bag nor box of a suitable size, and, gazing helplessly
around the room, realised how weak and nervous, and, above
all, how curiously dull and stupid, she was feeling. With
an impatient effort she pulled herself together, and concentrated
all her wits upon this question of a box. Finally,
she thought of her dressing-bag. By removing most of
the fittings she was able to crush into it all she had sorted
out to pack.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, slipping off the embroidered muslin morning-gown
she still wore, she sought for her plainest and most serviceable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
outdoor costume. Evarne&#39;s taste in dress in no ways
inclined to simplicity. She gloried in frills and furbelows,
dainty details, falling lace and fashionably cut skirts.
Even her tailor-built gowns were not really severe. The
fact that a brown face-cloth was made with a short skirt
prompted her choice. It was elaborately stitched and
strapped, but demure in tone, its only contrasting colour
being a touch of delicate rose-pink&mdash;chosen by Morris
himself to match the exquisite tint of her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">She took no ornaments, but drew from a corner in her
jewel-box a small enamel watch, the last gift of her father.
With a stifled sigh she wound it up, and, shaking it a little
to make it recommence its long-abandoned duties, pinned
it on her dress, while she laid the yet tinier bejewelled toy
that had superseded it back into the case.</p>

<p class="indent">She would scornfully leave behind every ornament that
had belonged to brighter days; Morris would find them
all and perhaps be a bit sorry! But money she must have,
and she looked anxiously into her purse. It contained but
a couple of napoleons and some silver. There were four
more gold pieces in her desk; her velvet bag with the
turquoises contained only two. The embroidered bag,
bought to match her latest green costume, contributed
three, while a few stray francs lay on the dressing-table.
She gathered them all into her lap and counted them.
Only a little over twelve napoleons altogether. It was
alarmingly little, but it would have to suffice. This done,
she again studied the hour. It was not yet four. She had
no idea when the earliest train set out, but felt convinced
that it could not start so matutinally.</p>

<p class="indent">It was nearly sixteen hours since she had last tasted
food, but she was not at all conscious of hunger. She was
in a strangely numbed state of mind. Beyond an impatience
to be once fairly off, she seemed unable to care
for aught else. Nothing mattered! Nothing ever could
matter now! Still, the sight of a plate of fruit reminded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
her of her long fast, and she half-peeled a banana, but
even as she raised it to her lips, a sudden repugnance at
the idea of eating anything further beneath this roof,
caused her to put it down untasted.</p>

<p class="indent">Ready even to her hat and gloves, she sank into an armchair
to wait an hour or so before venturing forth. Not
until she sat there, gazing with half-unseeing eyes around
the delicate room, did she begin to grasp the full significance
of the complete change that had so suddenly taken place
in her circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">Not only was her path in life to lie apart from Morris
Kenyon&#39;s for evermore, but she was abruptly and unexpectedly
plunged into the direst poverty. She had no
hope, even remotely, of a reconciliation with her onetime
lover, but she felt curiously calm and indifferent now.
Then, although she knew well enough that poverty, with
all its shifts, deprivations and unpleasantnesses would be
hateful to her&mdash;she could not feel really concerned at the
prospect. Nothing mattered&mdash;nothing ever could matter
again! Everything was finished!</p>

<p class="indent">She was without the least idea of what she could possibly
do to earn an honest livelihood. As far as went that
capacity, she was every whit as ill-placed as when her
father died. True, she had been studying art, more or
less seriously, for the last three years, but no one knew
better than herself how futile would be any attempt to
earn money by this means.</p>

<p class="indent">What then? The effort to think was painful. What
had come over her? Somehow she seemed incapable of
even remembering trades or professions, to see if she could
not manage to fulfil the necessary qualifications.</p>

<p class="indent">What did other young women do? Oh! of course, they
were governesses, or children&#39;s nurses, or companions to
invalids or old ladies, or&mdash;or&mdash;that sort of thing! But
posts such as these surely required some capacity, and
above all, a good reputation. She was, then, in truth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
worse off than when she had first left Heatherington
with Morris, so confident, so full of hopes for the
future.</p>

<p class="indent">What were girls allowed to do without their miserable
past existences being scrutinised? How about telephone
girls and those who served in shops of one sort and another,
those who were attendants in restaurants? Those who&mdash;who&mdash;well!
She couldn&#39;t think of anything else just
then; but there was clearly quite a choice of honest ways
of grubbing up a livelihood&mdash;if one must live at all! Without
exception, all appeared absolutely hateful. Viewed in
anticipation, it seemed as if she might as well be dead at
once, as devote all the days of one week to earning just
enough to keep herself alive the next week, so that she
might work through that, in order to be able to live the
next seven days, and so on, and so on, with cheap clothes,
poor food, scarce and low-class diversions, until old age
overtook her&mdash;and then&mdash;what?</p>

<p class="indent">She passed through a moment of positive fear and
repulsion, and instinctively her thoughts turned to Tony.
After all, was she not rushing into a battle in which she
must fall conquered. She could please men&mdash;that she
knew well&mdash;but could she do anything else in life? She
was so accustomed to wealth and ease and comfort now.
What could she do without it? Would the time ever come
when she would despairingly view this hour, when she
wilfully abandoned what certainly appeared the flowery
track through life, with its luxury, elegance, leisure for
higher pursuits, its surroundings of grace and beauty
that she appreciated so fully, and that only money&mdash;ill-gotten
or otherwise&mdash;can procure?</p>

<p class="indent">But the pride and purity of the spirit forbade any real
faltering in her resolve. Thousands of other girls lived&mdash;contentedly
enough she hoped and supposed&mdash;upon the
market value of their poor little capacities. Upon what
grounds was she to be held different? Young and strong,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
why should not she work as well as others? She felt she
ought to be ashamed of herself.</p>

<p class="indent">She shut her eyes so that she should no longer see
the tempting wealth and elegance she was abandoning.
Coloured spirals seemed to whirl in the darkness, and the
ensuing giddiness reminded her of her smelling-salts.
She slipped the bottle into her hand-bag, then resolved
not to sit down again, but to go. She had never before
taken a railway journey alone, and must allow ample time
for contingencies. It was getting on for five o&#39;clock.
The time was ripe.</p>

<p class="indent">She crept from her room, and very softly, with many a
pause to listen, proceeded to unfasten all hindering chains
and locks. But no sound was heard within the sleeping
flat, and undisturbed she gained the outer air.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris lay wrapped in slumber, all unconscious that the
child he had received at her dying father&#39;s hands, innocent
and wholly dependent on his honour, was now stealing
forth homeless into the chill morning, broken-hearted, with
a sullied story, and but a few pounds between herself and
utter destitution. Nor, had he known, would it have
caused him any serious pangs of remorse. The pride of
spirit, the refinement of sentiment, that forbade her to take
away any of the valuable gifts he had lavished upon her,
was totally beyond his comprehension. He could see that
it was a pretty enough conceit in theory, perchance, but
such a piece of high-faluting foolishness put into practice
was, to his mind, quite sufficient to deprive her of the
sympathy of all rational beings. In some peculiar manner
the fact that any immediate pecuniary difficulties would
be entirely of her own making, was in his mind all-sufficient
to absolve him from entire blame in the whole affair.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a quarter to six when Evarne arrived at the Gare
St. Lazare, and learned that the first train for Dieppe
started in five minutes. Hurrying to the booking-office,
she ordered a first single, then contradicted herself, asking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
for a second-class ticket. It was so difficult to have to
remember to economise.</p>

<p class="indent">The slow train, stopping at every station, took six hours
to cover the ground, but Evarne felt no impatience. The
steamer did not leave until half-past one, and until then
one place was as satisfactory as any other. Indeed, it
was even restful to sit quietly in a corner, and not have to
force her numbed brain to think and plan.</p>

<p class="indent">About nine o&#39;clock the train stopped at a station, where
she bought a cup of coffee and a roll. As she sipped and
nibbled she reflected that at a corresponding hour on the
previous morning she had eaten just such another little
<i>premier déjeuner</i>. How remote then appeared the prospect
of her very next similar meal being taken thus&mdash;parted
from Morris for ever, dazed and broken-hearted, bound in
solitude and fear for another land. &quot;After all, life ought
to be somewhat interesting, for it is certainly unexpected,&quot;
she thought, with a grim, mirthless little smile.</p>

<p class="indent">The Channel being on its best behaviour, she escaped
the additional trials of illness, but none the less, on arriving
at Newhaven, she felt incapable of further effort, and
resolved to put up there for the night. The day being
Sunday made a good excuse for this feebleness. It really
would be most undesirable to arrive in London on the
Sabbath evening. She turned with relief into the nearest
hotel, and went straight to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">She slept; she lay awake; she trembled beneath evil
dreams; she shed tears again. The long weary night
passed somehow, but left her haggard-eyed and unrefreshed.
A maid brought breakfast to her bedside, but
Evarne turned with repugnance from the stolid bacon
and overdone poached eggs, and it was after a mere pretence
of a meal that she arose, paid her bill, and took her
seat in the Victoria train.</p>

<h2><a name="chXIV" id="chXIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<small>HELPING HANDS</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a fresh and beautiful morning when she arrived
in London town. The sun shone, the sparrows
chirruped merrily, violets and mimosa were displayed
at the street-corners; English spring was at its
best. Evarne changed the remainder of her French gold
at the station, and then wandered out of its main entrance&mdash;aimlessly&mdash;ignorant
of where to go&mdash;which way to turn.</p>

<p class="indent">In the station yard she narrowly escaped being run over
by the numerous &#39;buses that were constantly either entering
or leaving. Her first impulse was to mount one of
these and let it take her where it would, but condemning
this as a foolish fancy, she crossed the road, and commenced
to wander down the street directly facing the station.
But the wide grandeur of Victoria Street was oppressive.
She was anxious to find the cheaper parts of London, and get
settled in a moderate-priced hotel or boarding-house
without delay. This feeling of absolute homelessness was
dreadful.</p>

<p class="indent">She was passing an attractive-looking refreshment-shop.
It was now about twenty to twelve, and at noon she was
accustomed to her first serious meal. She became aware
that she was sinking for lack of food, and entering, ordered
something to eat.</p>

<p class="indent">The neighbouring establishment was devoted to the
sale of religious pictures, crucifixes and other church
requisites, but taking advantage of the great width of the
pavement, the enterprising proprietor had placed outside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
his window some tressels and a board, which was now
covered with numerous second-hand books, under the
protection of a small boy.</p>

<p class="indent">As Evarne ate her meal she distracted her thoughts by
watching a girl who was seemingly proposing to purchase
a volume, for she was bestowing upon them a protracted
study. First one was picked up and glanced into, then
another, but Evarne soon saw that it was not the printed
wisdom that was filling her mind. Every few seconds her
eyes cast anxious glances in the direction of the station,
and ere long she abandoned even the pretence of book-gazing,
and stood there, frankly waiting and watching
for somebody.</p>

<p class="indent">She had obviously made her toilette with great care and
attention to detail. She wore a long coat and a white hat
with a black feather drooping over towards her shoulder.
She had on spotless white kid gloves and smart shoes,
and a little bunch of blossoms was fastened at her throat
by a small pearl brooch. Noticing all this, Evarne guessed
at once what it was that kept this girl loitering about thus
long, gazing so earnestly towards the station. &quot;She is in
love&mdash;I can see plainly. Little fool! It will only bring
her misery,&quot; was the verdict of this young cynic, for
suddenly the far-distant temple at Karnak had risen again
in her memory; she could see the cruel eye, the set lips,
of the Egyptian goddess of Love&mdash;of Sekhet&mdash;in her implacable
silent power.</p>

<p class="indent">At length Evarne felt compelled to take her departure.
But to where? Who could advise her? She studied the
countenance of the damsel by whom she had been waited
upon. It was not unpretty, but oh! so sadly shallow and
unsympathetic. No kindly aid would be forthcoming from
that quarter. Silently she quitted the shop.</p>

<p class="indent">Not far from the door stood the girl who had already
attracted her attention. She certainly did not look as if
she could be much acquainted with the shifts of poverty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
but she did look as if she could be kind and willing to be
helpful. Yielding this time to an impulse, Evarne approached,
and without preamble asked where one could
obtain cheap lodgings in London.</p>

<p class="indent">To her relief the girl with the plume did not evince the
least surprise. She appeared to consider it quite natural
to be asked such a question by a daintily-clad stranger,
and calmly proceeded to consider the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How cheap do you mean?&quot; she inquired. &quot;There
are a great many boarding-houses in Bloomsbury&mdash;near
the British Museum, you know&mdash;where you would be made
quite comfortable for two pounds a week, or even less.
Still, there are much cheaper ways of living than that, if
you prefer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne decided that Fate had guided her to one who
was, seemingly, an authority on precisely the class of
knowledge she was seeking. Two pounds a week was
certainly very moderate, but when one is possessed of less
than eight pounds in the world&mdash;no, that was beyond her
means. She could not allow her whole fortune to be dissipated
on a month&#39;s riotous living!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please tell me about the cheaper ways. How&mdash;do you
happen to know where girls live who can only spare one
pound a week?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it chiefly depends on the girl. Some hire cubicles
in clubs, or homes, or places of that sort, and get most of
their meals out. But it&#39;s not nice&mdash;they treat you as if
you were a child&mdash;I&#39;ve never known any one with any
&#39;go&#39; in them who liked it. Shall I tell you what I should
do myself?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, please do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should go to the stage-door of this music-hall just
here&quot;&mdash;and she carelessly waved her hand in the direction
of the edifice she mentioned. &quot;Then ask the doorkeeper
for some addresses, and he will tell you where the artistes
stay when they are engaged at the hall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
Here she broke off, and took a short step sideways in
order to see between the people passing to and fro, but
in a minute turned her attention again to Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can get a room and attendance for ten shillings
a week, or thereabouts, and arrange what you&#39;ll eat according
to the state of the exchequer. I&#39;ve done that
myself, so I know it isn&#39;t half-bad. You do your own
marketing, you understand, and the landlady does the
cooking.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhat surprised at this confidence, Evarne thanked
her gratefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I not fortunate in having ventured to ask you?&quot;
she said in her sweetest voice. &quot;I should never have
dreamed of such a nice way on my own account.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl with the plume seemed pleased, and accompanied
her the few steps to the corner of the side-street
in which the stage-entrance of the music-hall was to be
found; there they parted, and Evarne proceeded on her
exploring expedition alone. Sure enough, she soon beheld
a very narrow, red folding-door, over which &quot;Stage
Door&quot; appeared enticingly in white letters. The flaps
were already slightly ajar, and, pushing them wider open,
she peered inside the sacred portals.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a commissionaire&#39;s box sure enough, but no
official of any description to grace it. Nothing daunted,
Evarne climbed a winding flight of stairs that was just
ahead. This ended in a big, square landing, on to which
opened several doors. All were closed but one, which,
standing wide open, exposed to view a row of washing-basins
on a high table, a portion of uncarpeted floor on
which lay a jester&#39;s cap and a stuffed dog, a huge truss of
hay propped up in a corner, together with a couple of
guns, and a chair covered with a pile of garments.</p>

<p class="indent">Since, save for these rooms, the landing was a blank
alley, Evarne was about to descend when a step was heard,
and a very young man appeared in the open doorway.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
Partly with a view to accounting for her trespassing, the
girl explained: &quot;I want to find the hall-porter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The youth&#39;s response was far from useful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, he isn&#39;t here now, and I don&#39;t know where he is,
or when he will be back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The idea came to Evarne that possibly this stranger
might serve as well as the porter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wanted to ask if he could tell me of any nice lodgings
about here,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">The youth at once waxed quite enthusiastic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I can jolly well tell you that! We are staying
at the only decent place in the neighbourhood. We go
there about four times a year, and we wouldn&#39;t go to anybody
else than Mrs. Burling, not for toffee. When are you
coming in?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want a room at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I can&#39;t say what she&#39;s got vacant. We&#39;ve got&mdash;let
me see&mdash;a sitting-room, and one, two, three bedrooms.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you mind telling me what you pay for that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we&#39;re charged a pound a week for our lot, and
that&#39;s inclusive, coals and light and everything. I&#39;ll give
you the address. You can&#39;t better it, I&#39;ll take my oath.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He scribbled an address, and Evarne again sought the
outer air. At the corner of the street was the girl with
the plume, still waiting, who inquired after her success.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne showed her the slip of paper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the Vauxhall Bridge Road. Is that near by?&quot;
she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh yes; just cross over and go straight ahead, past
that clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But to get across this crowded thoroughfare was an
undertaking that Evarne, with her shaken nerves, was
scarcely capable of managing. Again and again she set
out only to return, startled and alarmed, to the pavement.
Undue timidity was so new to her that her pretty brow
deepened into wrinkles. It was dreadful that stress of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
mental suffering should have reduced her to this foolishly
weak and incapable condition of mind and body.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl with the plume once more came to the rescue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re not used to London, I can see. I&#39;ll take you
across. And now I&#39;ll just show you the right road,&quot; she
continued, when they had reached the opposite pavement
in safety.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do hope,&quot; declared Evarne slyly, &quot;that nobody
specially interesting will happen to come along over there
while you are being so kind as to see after me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her companion looked for a moment as if she had
suddenly discovered herself to be in the society of a clairvoyante.
Then she answered lightly enough&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter much if she does.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Evarne was not to be deceived by the feminine
pronoun.</p>

<p class="indent">In a couple of minutes the girl with the plume stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said, holding out her hand, &quot;and good
luck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was sorry to have to say farewell. She clasped
the hand that was offered her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye,&quot; she said roguishly, &quot;and I do hope that
then he&mdash;um&mdash;I mean she&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl with the plume interrupted her by a little laugh
of amusement. Evarne laughed too, and thus they
parted.</p>

<p class="indent">It was just a stray meeting&mdash;a momentary friendship
never to be renewed&mdash;but it put Evarne in a new frame
of mind. Whether it was owing to the meal, or to having
so far forgotten her own woes as to indulge in the fun of
bantering another girl, or whether it was to the practical
kindness and help she had received in finding a <i>pied-à-terre</i>,
she knew not; but certainly she walked down
Vauxhill Bridge Road with a considerably brighter expression
than heretofore.</p>

<p class="indent">The number found, her knock was answered by Mrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
Burling in person. Evarne inquired after accommodation
and terms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you a pro, miss?&quot; inquired Mrs. Burling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A pro?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean, are you on the stage yourself? But there, I
can see you ain&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl acknowledged it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does that matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a bit; come in, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne entered, and trying to close her nostrils against
the smell of onions that was wafted along the passage,
followed Mrs. Burling into a sitting-room. This apartment
was overcrowded by a suite of shiny black furniture,
and decorated lavishly with antimacassars, and objects of
one description and another under glass cases. The girl
thought it hideous, and almost unbearable to have to live
amid such surroundings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take a seat, miss. I&#39;ve only got a &#39;combined&#39; vacant
now, but next week&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want to pay much,&quot; confessed Evarne frankly.
&quot;How much is the &#39;combined,&#39; and may I see it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She hadn&#39;t the least idea of what a &quot;combined&quot; might
happen to be, but was not going to display her ignorance
twice within the first three minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burling led the way up a couple of steep flights of
stairs, into a smallish room that she herself probably
thought charmingly harmonious and attractive. Its walls
were covered with a dull yellowish paper whereon was a
design of pink poppies as big as one&#39;s head, with ramping
green leaves of a size to correspond. There were two cupboards
painted white, but picked out with green, while the
threadbare carpet was likewise of a verdant hue. By the
window was a writing-table, covered with an ink-stained
emerald cloth, and the wicker arm-chair that stood before
it tried to render itself cosy and enticing by means of a
couple of thin cushions&mdash;both green, sure enough, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
scarcely a happy combination of the shades of that colour
to be reposing cheek by jowl. In the corner stood a
spotlessly white fluffy-looking bed; there was a wardrobe
with a disfiguring mirror for the door; a washing-stand&mdash;with
china pink and green&mdash;altogether it was complete
enough, but oh!&mdash;Evarne&#39;s artistic soul shuddered.</p>

<p class="indent">However, she had made up her mind that the poor must
be easily pleased, and on learning that she could become
mistress of this domain for ten shillings weekly, inclusive,
she accepted the position without demur.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ave you got any more luggage at the station?&quot;
inquired the landlady, &quot;because my Tommy&#39;s got a
&#39;and-cart that he can bring it along in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne said that the bag she had left in the hall downstairs
was all she owned in that direction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s my custom to ask for part of the rent in advance,
miss,&quot; promptly announced Mrs. Burling.</p>

<p class="indent">Without comment, Evarne meekly opened her purse
and produced half-a-sovereign.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send up my bag, please,&quot; she said, and in another five
minutes found herself alone with all her worldly possessions
in her first independent home in London. Her new life
had indeed started.</p>

<h2><a name="chXV" id="chXV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />
<small>THE PROBLEM OF EXISTENCE</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">By</span> the time darkness fell solitude had become unendurable.
She did not know a single person in
London whom she could visit, so resolved to go
forth into the open streets. Even to see strangers
passing and repassing would be better than the companionship
of her own haunting memories.</p>

<p class="indent">She wandered around aimlessly, half-confused and somewhat
entertained by her first contact with busy London
after nightfall. She had soon strolled down Victoria
Street, and crossed Westminster Bridge, and was amid the
activity of the populous and poor south side of the Thames.</p>

<p class="indent">After a while, the sight of a noisy flaring street-market
in full swing, reminded her that she must make some
purchases if she wanted dinner on the morrow. Accordingly&mdash;after
commencing operations by buying a capacious
wicker marketing-basket, in emulation of the busy purchasers
who were evidently experienced housewives&mdash;she
set about considering her next day&#39;s <i>menu</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite her quiet demeanour, she attracted a great
deal of notice. Many heads were turned to gaze after her;
nudgings and whisperings heralded her approach. She
disliked this attention, and unaware that her face, apart
from its arresting beauty, still bore traces of the emotional
anguish she had so recently passed through, put it all down
to her attire. She could not fail to see that her costume&mdash;albeit
the simplest in her late wardrobe&mdash;was of an entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
different stamp to that worn by her surrounding sister-women,
and resolved on the morrow to get a really cheap
skirt and blouse for such occasions. That night, the purchase
of food required all her thought.</p>

<p class="indent">All went off well, save at the butcher&#39;s. There she
considered she made a fool of herself! Although it was
Monday night, each shop of this description was surrounded
by a crowd of carnivorous humanity. &quot;Buy, buy, buy!&quot;
the salesman was shouting encouragingly. &quot;Here&#39;s a
lovely little joint. Walk up and look&mdash;no call to buy.
Prime beef. Buy, buy, buy! Walk up, people, walk
up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At length Evarne followed this advice, and did &quot;walk
up.&quot; The counter outside the shop consisted of a series
of divisions marked by numbers ranging from four to ten,
and each containing a mass of smallish portions of meat.</p>

<p class="indent">Those in number ten partition looked less dried and utterly
repulsive than the rest, so, deciding on a tiny piece, the girl
daintily touched it with the tip of her finger and inquired
its price.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tenpence,&quot; shouted the noisy butcher, darting away
to attend to another customer.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne considered that was far too dear for such a wee
portion. She wasn&#39;t going to be cheated because she
was nicely dressed; she just wouldn&#39;t have that piece!
Settling upon a thin chop, she once again made business-like
inquiries concerning its price. Strange! This was
even smaller than her first choice, yet it was tenpence
likewise.</p>

<p class="indent">This was really puzzling. Ah! Perhaps it was tenpence
a piece, regardless of size. It didn&#39;t seem likely,
but if so, she would see that she got her money&#39;s worth,
and lifting up the largest portion of all she once more
succeeded in attracting the butcher&#39;s attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much is this bit, then?&quot; she inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">The unkind butcher man actually got rude. &quot;Lor&#39; love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
yer, can&#39;t yer &#39;ear me a-telling yer it&#39;s <i>tenpence</i>, and ain&#39;t
it printed plain enough?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was affronted by this unaccustomed disrespect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll take this piece, then,&quot; she announced with the air of
a duchess, whereupon the man, in no ways abashed,
promptly flung it out of sight under a row of hanging joints,
into the interior of the shop.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne remained stationary.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Walk inside, miss,&quot; cried the man, as the crowd jostled,
and others claimed his attention.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl obeyed. In its turn her choice was put on the
scales.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thirteen ounces, sevenpence-halfpenny,&quot; cried the
weigher, wrapping it up with all speed in a bit of newspaper
and handing it over.</p>

<p class="indent">Only then did it dawn on Evarne that this universal
price of tenpence meant nothing more nor less than tenpence
a pound, and thus the mystery was explained!
Until recently she would have laughed merrily over such
an incident, but now all life was the colour of tragedy.
She saw in this absurd little incident only an allegory of her
all-round practical ignorance, her incapacity, her sordid
position, and the general misery and humiliation of her
probable future. She returned home weary and dejected,
and that night likewise soaked her pillow with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">She breakfasted in bed, then dressed and went out to
get a newspaper to study the list of situations vacant.
Buying two or three she inquired the way to the nearest
public gardens. The policeman directed her to Hyde Park,
and ere long she was seated facing the Row, idly watching
the equestrians as they cantered past.</p>

<p class="indent">How cheerful, how light-hearted, they all seemed!</p>

<p class="indent">People on foot, even though richly clad, often looked
discontented and ill-natured. Those driving in the finest
of motors, or the most splendid of carriages, with prancing
horses and all outward tokens of luxury, might appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
dreadfully bored with existence; but one and all who
were mounted upon these well-groomed steeds on this fresh
spring morning appeared to radiate health and happiness
as they passed.</p>

<p class="indent">It was scarcely a kind Fate that brought Evarne to this
spot, with the very papers in her hand in which she hoped
to find the printed announcement of some quiet little
corner in the labour market into which she might creep to
earn mere bread and cheese. She looked with eyes that
were frankly envious upon the riders. How unfair it
seemed that some people should have so much money and
others none at all unless they either slaved or sinned.</p>

<p class="indent">Had she been plunged into poverty with Morris still
true&mdash;still loving her&mdash;she could have faced the turn of
Fortune&#39;s wheel with a stout heart and a cheery smile.
But the stroke that had been dealt to her affections seemed
to have crushed her very spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor had she any, save her own moral resources, upon
which to lean for support. This would have seemed a
period when the glorious and elevating influence of Socrates
should have had power to lift her into lofty realms of
philosophical resignation. But for the greatest of her
griefs, the most gnawing, the most unendurable, the teacher
was worse than useless. Scant comfort does he give to
those whose love is unhappy. On the contrary, his words,
his ideas, as they had been interpreted by Evarne, merely
served to gall the wound, and she dared not dwell upon
them.</p>

<p class="indent">She did not open her papers, but sat watching the
passing throng. She smiled as two little girls came galloping
by at full speed. They rode astride, and a groom led
the pony of the youngest by a leading-rein. The hats of
both tiny maidens had blown back, their flying curls rose
and fell, their faces were flushed bright pink with excitement
and delight. Next a young woman rode past at a
walking pace. By her side was a man. She too looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
radiantly happy, but it was not the exhilaration of exercise
that had brought that glad light into her eyes. Evarne
looked after them sympathetically. Although her own
story had ended in destruction and misery, she still found
a pair of earnest young lovers the most interesting&mdash;the
most attractive&mdash;sight in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">Numbers of elderly rotund gentlemen trotted along.
For them the morning ride was but a doctor&#39;s prescription&mdash;still,
they took it with a cheerful countenance&mdash;this
delightful recipe! Then passed two women, both evidently
over fifty; they still possessed elegant and slender
figures, shown off by immaculate habits. They were
mounted on magnificent horses&mdash;lithe, powerful, big&mdash;horses
fit to carry heavy men, and to whom the weight of
these slight women must have been a mere nothing. Evarne
imagined that these two riders were wealthy maiden sisters&mdash;the
great ladies of some country district&mdash;who came to
London just for the season. She fancied they had lived
side by side in state and dignity from infancy upwards, and
that there had never been a hero in the story of either of
their lives.</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately after them came a golden-haired damsel&mdash;gay,
<i>débonnaire</i>, handsome&mdash;but marred by an irrefutable
touch of vulgarity. Her fine form and shady morals had
gone to make her a prosperous career! Her life had never
been without a hero. Next came a youthful and highborn
mother, cantering easily, looking down with smiling
care and pride upon the gallant little son and heir who
rode so manfully beside her on a shaggy white pony.
Ah! there was life, happiness, health, wealth, love&mdash;everything!
But she must waste no more time. Moving
to a less prominent seat she opened her papers.</p>

<p class="indent">Doubtless if Evarne had been an artistic genius she
would have declined to abandon entirely the pursuit of
art. As it was, knowing her own incompetence, she at
once hopelessly renounced all ideas of art as a profession.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
What then offered itself? If she had happened to possess
a knowledge of shorthand there were many openings, but
then she didn&#39;t happen to, so that was no use! A smart
girl about eighteen was wanted to assist in a grill-room and
make herself generally useful. A stifling grill-room!
Horrible! Some bakers required a young lady as bookkeeper
and to assist in shop. Arithmetic had never been
her strong point. A barmaid was wanted. Heaven forbid!
Another lady was required to push the boot trade.
&quot;Pushing&quot; anything was also not her strong point.</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;C&#39;s&quot; were all cashiers and clerks. Arithmetic
and shorthand again. Useless! Oh, there was also a
demand for cooks. Well, she could boil eggs and potatoes,
and make toast, but that was hardly sufficient. Drapery
establishments required ladies for various departments.
That was decidedly the most promising so far. She would
write to some of these. Dressmakers wanted hands,
assistants, improvers and apprentices. Oh dear, dear!
Several hotels wanted manageresses or housekeepers, and
an infirmary required a female lunatic attendant. It was
terribly disheartening work. Lady canvassers&mdash;that again
required the gift of being pushing. Laundry-managers&mdash;mantle-machinists&mdash;milliners&mdash;servants.
There ended the
choice. Appalling!</p>

<p class="indent">However, she proceeded to answer a few of the advertisements,
when the idea came to consult Mrs. Burling. The
landlady was a practical working-woman, and therefore
perhaps the very best possible adviser.</p>

<p class="indent">So Evarne to a certain extent became confidential.
What did Mrs. Burling think was the easiest way of earning
a livelihood for a girl who had not been taught any profession,
and who, owing to deaths and unexpected losses,
found herself obliged to earn money right away?</p>

<p class="indent">Without a moment&#39;s hesitation, Mrs. Burling suggested
the stage. This was not unnatural, considering that the
worthy matron spent her days waiting hand and foot upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
plain, commonplace women and inane men, who, by that
means, contrived to lead leisured lives. That was the one
and only trade, business or profession she knew of that
seemed to call for neither brains, industry, previous preparation,
nor&mdash;in her opinion&mdash;any particular talent or qualification
whatsoever.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do assure you, miss,&quot; she went on, &quot;I&#39;ve &#39;ad ladies
and gents &#39;ere earning good money, who would &#39;ave been
in the work&#39;ouse if they wasn&#39;t in the profession.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne considered. She was blankly ignorant of everything
connected with life behind the scenes. True, she
had met several so-called &quot;actresses&quot; in the society of
Morris&#39;s friends, but these ladies never seemed to be acting,
so she could not consider that they represented the genuine
article. She had a vague idea&mdash;gleaned from she scarce
knew where&mdash;that the men of the dramatic world were all
vulgar and vain and familiar and inclined to drink, unless,
on the other hand, they were popular, fascinating and
romantic; while the women were jealous, rather rowdy,
and overdressed, until those upper ranks were reached
wherein they figured on picture postcards, when they were
models of every public and domestic virtue. Still, to the
girl&#39;s imagination, a stage life certainly seemed far more
bearable than the vision of herself measuring out lace and
ribbon from morn to eve; or serving round grilled chops;
or fighting with lunatics.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I really think I shall try that,&quot; she announced at
length; &quot;but I&#39;m dreadfully ignorant about how to get
a post. Does one go to the theatres, or write to the leading
actors, or the managers, or what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s all sorts of ways,&quot; declared Mrs. Burling.
&quot;For one thing, you must &#39;ave a good photo of yourself
to send round. What &#39;ave you got?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne confessed that she had nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you must &#39;ave one took, and &#39;ave sticky-backs
made from it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
&quot;Sticky-backs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, fifty a shilling. Don&#39;t you know &#39;em? I&#39;ve
got some stuck in my visitors&#39; book. I&#39;ll get it, and let
you see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She returned in due course and presented the volume.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got a message for you,&quot; she went on. &quot;I jist
mentioned to the ladies and gents in the sitting-room,
when I went in to git the book, what I wanted it for,
and when they &#39;eard you&#39;d never bin on the stage and was
thinking of starting, they sent up an invite that if you&#39;d
take supper with &#39;em when they return from the &#39;all this
evening, they&#39;d be very &#39;appy to give you some advice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that is kind of them,&quot; declared Evarne with
alacrity. &quot;Will you tell them I&#39;ll be very pleased to
accept?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burling took her departure, and the girl amused
herself by studying the visitors&#39; book. Clearly, no praise
of the worthy landlady was deemed too exaggerated, and
quite often tactful self-advertisements had been unblushingly
inserted by the writers. Evarne studied the
method by which it was achieved, with a view to future
use. Thus &quot;Wally Wentworth, Mrs. Wally Wentworth
and Miss Arundale Sutherland, on highly successful return
visit with sketch, &#39;The Perils of the Dark,&#39; stopped here,
and found complete satisfaction with both cooking and
accommodation.&quot; Very ingenious!</p>

<p class="indent">Another, a gentleman whose jolly countenance was
preserved to future ages through the medium of a &quot;sticky-back,&quot;
declared&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Owing to being braced up by Mother Burling&#39;s high-class
cookery, sang &#39;Cats a-walking on the tiles&#39; and
&#39;Lazy Lily&#39;s Lullaby&#39; as never before! Brought down
the house!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Giggling Coon Girls&quot; were also full of praises
of Mrs. Burling, but did not forget to add that at the music
hall they were &quot;encored nightly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
Evarne was quite carried away by the childish self-complacency,
the light-hearted tone of gaiety that pervaded
this book, and began to wax quite enthusiastic
over the idea of going on the stage herself. Perhaps
she would be a great success, and become famous, and
earn any amount of money. Then Morris, of course, would
hear of her triumphs, and then&mdash;&mdash;But she stayed these
fairy visions with a stern hand as soon as Morris appeared
in them. The pain grew too cruel. Nothing could ever
undo the past.</p>

<p class="indent">She wondered if she could act well. She had never
had any ambition in that direction, and so had never
tried, not even as an amateur. But surely anyone could
learn to undertake small parts quite easily. She did not
expect to be called upon to play &quot;Juliet&quot; or &quot;Pauline
Deschapelles&quot; immediately.</p>

<p class="indent">The hours passed. She found an old novelette in a
drawer, and occupied her time in reading the rubbish,
until a scream of laughter, the bang of a door and a general
sense of uproar, proclaimed that the &quot;sketch party&quot;
had returned from its evening labours. A few minutes
later a tap came on the door, and in response to the injunction
to &quot;Come in,&quot; a tall, slender girl, with faint
traces of &quot;make-up&quot; still clinging around her eyes, appeared
on the threshold.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ve come back, Miss Stornway,&quot; she announced
in a friendly manner, &quot;and I&#39;ve come up to bring you
down to have a bit of supper with us as arranged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Willingly enough Evarne went downstairs. The meal
was laid in readiness in the sitting-room, where two men
and a buxom middle-aged female, all lounging around
waiting for the first course to appear, seemed to fill the
already overfurnished place to repletion.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl who had run up to conduct the guest downstairs
now undertook the task of effecting a general introduction.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
&quot;This is Mr. Hal Cuthbert, the manager of our &#39;Fun
in the Hayfield&#39; sketch company,&quot; she commenced,
indicating the elder of the two men. &quot;This is Mrs. Hal
Cuthbert.&quot; The lady in question bowed so deliberately
and graciously that Evarne felt constrained to solemnly
return the formal salutation. &quot;This is Mr. Bertie Anderson.&quot;
Here the girl exchanged smiles with her acquaintance
at the hall. &quot;My name is Margaret Macclesfield, and
you are Miss Stornway, so now we all know one another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Everyone hereupon started to speak at once, but Mrs.
Burling appearing with a dish of soused mackerel, all
subsided for a moment, took their seats, and the little
meal commenced.</p>

<p class="indent">Very soon Evarne arrived at the conclusion that if
this party was typical of theatrical ladies and gentlemen,
she had been vastly mistaken in her estimate of such.
They were evidently not unlike ordinary human beings,
only rather jollier. They were very lively, very light-hearted,
easily amused at not remarkably brilliant witticisms,
whether the product of their own genius or that
of their companions. They were, moreover, exceedingly
frank and open, telling her all about themselves, their
whole history and that of their respective families. They
waxed enthusiastic on their past dramatic successes and
their future hopes&mdash;future fears they seemed not to possess.
Altogether Evarne quite forgot herself, and enjoyed the
chatter after her period of involuntary solitude. It was
not until the meal was over, and tobacco fumes filled the
air, that the subject of her future on the stage was mooted.</p>

<p class="indent">But this little band of professionals was far less sanguine
and encouraging than Mrs. Burling had been.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Hal Cuthbert opened the debate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a dreadfully overcrowded profession you are
thinking of embarking on, Miss Stornway, and unless
you have influence or money, even talent has a hard fight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have no influence, and very little money, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
don&#39;t really know that I&#39;ve got any special talent,&quot; declared
this applicant for stage honours, making no attempt to
conceal the true state of affairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Cuthbert shook his head portentously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is not a very hopeful prospect,&quot; he declared.
&quot;Haven&#39;t you got a voice? There&#39;s a piano yonder.
Let&#39;s hear what you can do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne in her turn shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m afraid I
can&#39;t sing,&quot; she said regretfully. &quot;I&#39;ve never had my
voice trained at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A momentary silence seized the party.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps you can dance?&quot; suggested Margaret Macclesfield,
hopefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only ordinary ballroom dances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s no go,&quot; and a silence still more melancholy,
more profound, held sway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s no place for you on the halls, then. Perhaps
you&#39;d do all right in legitimate drama. Can you recite
something?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know anything dramatic,&quot; Evarne
was obliged to confess, her cheeks growing pinker. &quot;I
don&#39;t know much poetry at all, and what I have learnt
from time to time are only pretty little bits that have
taken my fancy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Mr. Cuthbert was recommencing,
when his wife broke in&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you do it, my dear. It&#39;s a dreadful profession
for them as haven&#39;t got the gifts. It&#39;s a grinding, killing
business. I&#39;d as soon see a girl of mine in her grave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old lady isn&#39;t far wrong,&quot; agreed Mr. Cuthbert.
&quot;You take my advice, Miss Stornway, and try something
else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But,&quot; declared Evarne despairingly, &quot;whatever I
tried it would be just the same. I&mdash;I&#39;m not properly
qualified for anything. It&#39;s not my fault, but there it is!
I didn&#39;t think of the stage when I found I&#39;d got to earn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
my own living, but now it has been suggested to me I feel
sure I stand a better chance of earning money quickly that
way than any other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve got a real beautiful face, if you don&#39;t mind my
being personal,&quot; said Margaret. &quot;Perhaps you might
get a thinking part, right enough&mdash;or there&#39;s pantomime.
You&#39;re tall, aren&#39;t you? If you&#39;ve got good legs and a
fine figure&mdash;&mdash;What&#39;s your waist?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yet once again Evarne was compelled to shake her head
apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid&mdash;&mdash;&quot; she started, then stopped abruptly.
However, frankness seemed to prevail here, so she continued
after an imperceptible pause. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve got
what you mean by a fine figure. I need very careful and
special dressing to look really nice. You see, I don&#39;t wear
corsets, and so&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear!&quot; interrupted both ladies simultaneously,
&quot;how can you manage without?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I was brought up to it,&quot; explained the girl
hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should feel as if I&#39;d got no backbone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn&#39;t keep up. I should flop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you can wear some now if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s exactly what I can&#39;t do. I tried once, quite
seriously, and it made me ill&mdash;really ill&mdash;and I don&#39;t
suppose it gets any easier to change one&#39;s habits as one
gets older.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Cuthbert flourished her hands despairingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s no go, my dear. Put the idea of the stage out of
your head at once. No voice, no talents, no experience,
no money, and no waist!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A general cry of expostulation greeted this rather cruel
<i>résumé</i> of poor Evarne&#39;s deficiencies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve got a lovely face anyway, my dear,&quot; said Mr.
Hal, &quot;and you look to have a nice figure, whether you have
really or not, if I may say as much. I think the old lady&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
advice is good, but you mustn&#39;t let your feelings be
hurt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; declared the girl stoutly. &quot;It&#39;s only
too good of you to trouble about me at all, and you mustn&#39;t
think me either vain or ungrateful if I say that I am still
resolved to try my luck. I believe I could act, and I&#39;ve
never yet found my personal appearance a disadvantage
to me; I expect that, even without corsets, I can manage
to look as well as the average girl. I must start to earn
money at once, that&#39;s sadly certain. I&#39;ve been thinking
over every other means, and none of them seem suitable,
so if you would end up your kindness by giving me some
hints as to how to get work on the stage at once I shall
be infinitely obliged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Their good-nature in no way disturbed by their unanimous
judgment being thus flouted, they gave her advice
as best they could. Like Mrs. Burling, they declared it
was imperative she should have some photos of herself
to send round. Then she must go to agents, and answer
advertisements in the theatrical papers, and&mdash;well, really
it was hard to say, engagements came somehow&mdash;if any
of them got a chance they would certainly put in a word
for her.</p>

<p class="indent">For this she was duly grateful, and a little later the
party broke up.</p>

<h2><a name="chXVI" id="chXVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<small>EVARNE&#39;S FIRST ENGAGEMENT</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning, accompanied by the two younger
of her new acquaintances, Evarne sallied forth
in search of a photographer&#39;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Carefully they studied various photographic
show-cases of modest pretensions. She was reluctant to
spend any of her limited capital in so seemingly frivolous a
manner, and was anxious to expend as small a sum as
possible on this preliminary. But here it was clearly
possible to be &quot;penny wise, pound foolish,&quot; and she recoiled
at the prospect of being made to look anything like
the self-conscious, staring, pictured females that the really
low-priced artists of the camera set forth as attractive
products of their prowess&mdash;the specimens best calculated
to tickle the vanity of the passers-by and draw them into
the toils of the producer of such representations.</p>

<p class="indent">At length they discovered one whose masterpieces
seemed less terrible than those of his rivals. Margaret
undertook the <i>rôle</i> of spokesman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only one copy of each position is required,&quot; she said, &quot;but
they must be delivered without delay, as the young lady is
on the stage, and needs them immediately for professional
purposes,&quot; and she went on to bargain about reduced prices.</p>

<p class="indent">After the operator&#39;s shutter had made its significant
click two or three times, the party wended their way to
the Strand, and Evarne had her name duly inscribed upon
several agents&#39; books. In some cases this privilege cost
money, and she returned home horrified by the rapidity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
with which funds melted. True, Bertie Anderson had
&quot;stood&quot; both girls their luncheon, but despite this, the
day&#39;s output had been something alarming.</p>

<p class="indent">Everyone in the house continued to concern themselves
over her welfare. Indeed, from the first hour of her
arrival in London she had met with nothing but goodwill.
Herein Heaven watched over her, for this general
kindliness on the part of mankind at large was the best
possible balm for her scorned and wounded affections.
True, no care from others could really touch the injury
inflicted by &quot;the one,&quot; but it all served to help melt the
ice that seemed gathered around her breast.</p>

<p class="indent">Her acquaintance with the merry, good-natured &quot;Fun in
the Hayfield&quot; people proved a veritable salvation. Left to
herself for any appreciable period, she weakly sank into
a state of brooding despair, but save for the evening of
the &quot;photographer-hunting&quot; day, she was in their society
for practically the whole of the remainder of the week.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Cuthbert had offered to pass her into the music hall
that night, but she declined the offer. She was tired, and
shrank from the anticipated noise and glare. But once
alone she regretted her decision. Memories of the past
crowded thick upon her, with their train of regrets, hot
indignation, bitter sorrow, and the thousand and one
tearing passions that rendered thought unendurable.
Solitude was&mdash;for the present at least&mdash;but a state of
torture to be avoided at all costs. Distraction, company,
variety was no longer a matter of choice, but an absolute
necessity. She had vainly endeavoured to find relief
from the agony of thought by mingling with the passing
crowds. Despairing, she returned home and to bed, but
her brain had worked itself into a tumult during the long
evening hours, and no sleep came. Long she lay awake,
weeping, hating, yearning and lamenting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You look paler than ever, Evarne, my dear! Whatever
have you been doing to yourself?&quot; cried Margaret,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
who came up to present her with some chocolates from a
box that some admiring &quot;chap&quot; had sent round to the
stage door. She was in high feather over the little gift.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;People think we get so many flowers given us we haven&#39;t
vases to put them in, and so many pairs of gloves we haven&#39;t
hands enough to wear them, and so many sweeties we haven&#39;t
digestions enough to tackle them all, let alone cheques and
presents of jewellery about once a week!&quot; she exclaimed;
&quot;but I assure you that&#39;s a jolly big mistake, as you&#39;ll find
out, dear. Come on, tuck in to chocs and take some of this
row. They&#39;ve got pinky cream, and you&#39;ll have to put
some colour on from the outside, if you can&#39;t manage to
provide it somehow from the inside,&quot; and she laughed gaily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do hate to be alone,&quot; explained Evarne, brightening
visibly at the effect of this chatter. &quot;I&mdash;I&#39;ve had great
trouble lately, and when I&#39;m by myself&mdash;well&mdash;I think!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Margaret was full of sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor dear, don&#39;t &#39;think&#39; then, don&#39;t be alone. I
know what we will do. I&#39;m going to order Mrs. Burling
to serve your meals along with ours, and we will see if we
can&#39;t cheer you up among us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like that,&quot; cried Evarne, jumping at the
idea. Thus until the following Sunday, when these kind
friends moved on to play their &quot;sketch&quot; in a hall right
out of London, she was scarcely left alone for an hour.
Every night she went with Mrs. Cuthbert and Margaret to
their dressing-room, where she assisted in arraying them,
and was instructed in the many mysteries of &quot;making-up.&quot;
She learnt many things&mdash;the knack of melting cosmetic in
a teaspoon and applying it to the eyelashes with a hairpin&mdash;how
to fluff out her hair by combing it the wrong way&mdash;how
to transform a skin of common lard into glorified
face-grease, sweetly smelling of essence of bergamot&mdash;and
a dozen other little tricks of the trade.</p>

<p class="indent">Either Margaret or Bertie accompanied her on her daily
visits to the agents, and on Thursday morning&mdash;albeit she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
had as yet no &quot;sticky-backs&quot;&mdash;they helped her study the
new number of the <i>Stage</i>. Her experienced friends warned
her that the approach of summer was not a favourable
time to find &quot;a shop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless there seemed to Evarne a goodly and various
demand in the &quot;Wanted&quot; column. There were openings
for pretty attractive chorus girls, soubrettes, a good responsible
lady, a powerful leading lady, a pathetic old lady, a
show lady, an emotional juvenile lady, and a dashing heavy
lady; and if one couldn&#39;t place one&#39;s self under any of these
descriptions, then one could modestly seek to be a &quot;chambermaid.&quot;
Also there were sweeping invitations for whole
companies to &quot;write in.&quot; Accordingly Evarne &quot;wrote
in&quot;&mdash;spent 1s. 3d. on stamps&mdash;then waited.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the week she was forced to part from her
kind friends. She assured them that for their sakes she
would henceforward and forever cherish an affectionate
regard for the whole of the theatrical fraternity. Faithful
promises of correspondence were exchanged, and then the
girl found herself thrown upon her own society.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burling had already let her sitting-room for the
coming week, but the two men who now occupied it&mdash;low
comedians&mdash;appeared to fastidious Evarne as very low
specimens of humanity likewise. So, when one of them&mdash;encountering
her on the front doorstep&mdash;showed a tendency
to be affable, she received the poor fellow&#39;s effort most coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">However, her time was now fully occupied. She marketed
daily, haunted the theatrical agents, read poetry
aloud in her best dramatic style in the privacy of her room,
and occasionally expended a shilling on the gallery of some
theatre to study acting and find out how it was done.</p>

<p class="indent">By the time the next theatrical paper appeared, she was
the owner of fifty small replicas of the most attractive of her
new photographs, and she desperately set to work to answer
almost every advertisement&mdash;likely and unlikely. Alack
and alas, not a single response crowned her efforts!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
Then she nearly sank into utter despondency. Whatever
was to be done? No work forthcoming, and her
little hoard of money melting away like snow in a thaw.
Why, it was enough to test the fortitude of the bravest!
She was almost in despair by the time she had been in
London two weeks, and was still as far from being a wage-earner
as when she first arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">So the reaction was correspondingly great, when a day
or two later she beheld a letter for herself with a Scotch
postmark and addressed in a strange handwriting. Mrs.
Burling&mdash;sympathetically excited&mdash;had hurried upstairs
with the precious missive and proceeded to wipe some
imaginary dust from a vase, while her young lodger tore
open the envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">The notepaper was headed &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard Co.,&quot;
and beneath this was printed a few puffs of the aforesaid
concern, which&mdash;if one went by its own account&mdash;carried
a full cast of the most talented artistes, rich and handsome
costumes, realistic scenery, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">The written address given was Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow,
and the letter stated that the manager of &quot;Caledonia&#39;s
Bard&quot; offered &quot;the small yet effective part&quot; of &quot;Bess&quot;
in that production to Miss Stornway, at the remuneration
of twenty-one shillings weekly. Miss Stornway was to
provide her own costumes, which, however, were of the
simplest description, and should she be still at liberty to
accept the offer, a gentleman would call upon her to deliver
into her hands a railway ticket to Glasgow. The communication
was signed &quot;P. Punter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Its recipient beamed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got an offer, really!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Would
you like to see it?&quot; With these words she handed the
letter over to Mrs. Burling, who perused it slowly from start
to finish, then sniffed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A guinea a week, find your own dresses, and go to
Glasgow! &#39;Tain&#39;t up to much, to my way o&#39; thinking, miss.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
And &#39;e don&#39;t tell you when the tour opens, nor where it
ends up, nor no idea of &#39;ow long it&#39;s going to last, nor
nothing about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne had not noticed these deficiencies, and now
did not heed them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind! It&#39;s an engagement, and that&#39;s everything,&quot;
she cried gleefully. &quot;I shall hurry up and accept
before someone else does;&quot; and seizing pen and paper she
wrote her reply.</p>

<p class="indent">At all events &quot;P. Punter&quot; appeared a prompt and businesslike
individual. By return of post came a couple of pencil
sketches and instructions concerning the costumes she was
to provide for herself. There was also an illegibly written
copy of her part, and the request that she would be in Glasgow
to commence rehearsals by the following Wednesday.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne smoothed out that most interesting document&mdash;the
script of her first dramatic <i>rôle</i>&mdash;and studied it eagerly.
She supposed &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard&quot; was Robert Burns, for
references to &quot;Bobbie&quot; were frequent. She could not
glean much idea of the plot from her part, nor did the words
she was to utter appear likely to call forth any great histrionic
talent that might be lying unsuspected within her
breast. As far as she could gather, all the scenes of the play
took place by the deathbed of &quot;Highland Mary.&quot; She
read out a speech to Mrs. Burling as a specimen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now lie ye still, bonnie Mary, lie ye still. Sure, Bobbie
will greet sair to see ye laid sae low. For his sake, Mary,
ye must get the roses back agin into your bonnie cheeks,
now sae white, Mary. Oh, doctor, is she no a wee bit
better, think ye?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it went on. &quot;Bonnie Mary&quot; was obviously a most
obstreperous patient, and it evidently called forth all
&quot;Bess&#39;s&quot; powers of persuasion to make her die quietly in
bed. &quot;Mary&quot; apparently took to seeing visions as the
play waxed more thrilling, and &quot;Bess&quot; was required
to employ &quot;gentle strength&quot; to persuade her charge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
to obey the injunction, repeated with wearying reiteration,
&quot;Rest ye calm, Mary; rest ye calm.&quot; Indeed, the
idea did flash across Evarne that she might almost as
well have undertaken to tend lunatics in the privacy of
an infirmary, as she was seemingly to do much the same
sort of thing on the boards and under the public gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not very inspiring, is it?&quot; she said rather despondently,
but at the same time she was relieved to find
that no serious demands were to be made upon her&mdash;as yet
untried&mdash;dramatic abilities.</p>

<p class="indent">She went out to buy the brown serge and the blue cotton
material necessary for her two costumes, and on her return
was told that during her absence a gentleman from Scotland
had called and gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must be my ticket,&quot; exclaimed the girl. &quot;Didn&#39;t
he leave it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burling handed her an envelope. In it Evarne found
the return-half of a third-class ticket from Glasgow to London.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me, we are going to break the regulations of the
railway company, I see,&quot; was her first thought.</p>

<p class="indent">However, the arrival of the ticket seemed to make the
engagement real&mdash;a settled fact. She was now fully in the
throes of an actress&#39;s life. As she sat studying her part
and stitching away at her stage costumes, she recalled the
early days of Mrs. Siddons and various other great theatrical
stars, and tried hard to feel resigned concerning the past
and the present, and hopeful for the future. She determined
to force herself to become ambitious. She would
live for and think only of professional success, and dream
no more of Morris.</p>

<p class="indent">More of her precious money had to be expended. A
&quot;make-up&quot; outfit was essential, also a small theatrical
touring basket, together with several other more or less
expensive items. Thus by the time she had settled her
final account with Mrs. Burling, there was less than two
pounds in her purse with which to set forth for Glasgow.</p>

<h2><a name="chXVII" id="chXVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<small>A STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE PROFESSION</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Depositing</span> her box at the Glasgow station left-luggage
office, she set out to discover Sauchiehall
Street. In this, of course, no difficulty
arose, but when it came to finding the actual
house&mdash;well, that appeared a total impossibility. Evarne
was almost inclined to believe that she had come to Scotland
on a wild-goose chase, for there seemed to exist no
such address as that with which Mr. Punter had headed his
letters. There was the number above and the number
below the very one she required, but between them&mdash;where
the house she sought would naturally have been expected
to stand&mdash;was merely a piece of unused building ground.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a forlorn, unkempt spot, with straggling grasses
and weeds, amid which were piles of bricks and stone,
fragments of torn paper, an old boot, and other such débris
as will accumulate on waste ground, even though it be in
the very centre of the principal street of a big city. As
if to make it serve at least one useful purpose, there had
been erected on it an enormous hoarding, covered with
advertisements.</p>

<p class="indent">Here was a regular mystery! Inquiries respecting the
address she was seeking were vain. She walked anxiously
up and down Sauchiehall Street, half hoping to find the
missing number somehow transported from its legitimate
numerical position, but all to no avail. Again and again
she returned to survey the deserted site where Mr. Punter&#39;s
residence <i>ought</i> to be. Unless he camped in the shadow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
of the hoarding, as did one or two stray cats&mdash;a sudden
thought flashed across her! Pushing past the small
gate that hung partly open on its hinges, and ploughing
her way through the long grass, she penetrated round to
the back of the hoarding. There it was, after all&mdash;a
house sure enough&mdash;partly tumbled down, it is true, with
broken windows, fallen chimneys, and a general air of
having been long abandoned by mankind; still, a house,
even though half the roof had collapsed. More than that;
close by, on a large wooden frame, hung a roughly painted
theatrical drop-scene. The place was found!</p>

<p class="indent">But what a habitation for a civilised human being!
What sort of a person was Mr. Punter? Was he a gipsy&mdash;a
tramp? Was he in the last stages of poverty, or merely
eccentric? The girl approached the front door. Its
upper half was formed of thick panels of stained glass,
now cracked and broken in a dozen places, but with brown
paper carefully pasted on the inner side to cover the actual
holes. Knocking boldly with the end of her umbrella,
Evarne waited, though half prepared to receive no answer.</p>

<p class="indent">But after a moment&#39;s silence there came a sound of a
window being thrown open, and a voice called out from
somewhere aloft, &quot;Hullo!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stepped back and looked upwards. A youth,
wrapped in a blanket, was gazing down upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I suppose you are Madame Sheep, or Miss Stornway?&quot;
he exclaimed. &quot;Stop a minute, and I&#39;ll be down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With these words he vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">Decidedly &quot;intrigued,&quot; the girl waited patiently. How
very unlike was this reception to anything her wildest
imagination had anticipated. An inhabited ruin, the
occupant thereof clad in the bedclothes, peering down
from an upper window to inquire if she was herself or some
person who possessed the weird name of &quot;Madame Sheep!&quot;
She felt as if it were part of a ridiculous dream.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, the door was opened, not by the blanketed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
youth, but by a middle-aged man, small and short, with
a head beginning to grow bald and a face clean-shaven,
save for curious old-fashioned side-whiskers.</p>

<p class="indent">Hailing the girl by name with the heartiness of an old
friend, he led the way across the hall and into a large room
on the ground floor. It was totally unfurnished, save for
a rough wooden table, a bench and a couple of chairs.
On one of these Evarne was invited to take a seat.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, this little individual was &quot;the&quot; Mr. Punter in
person. He proceeded to hold forth in enthusiastic terms
concerning the future prospects of &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard.&quot;
The play had never been produced yet, that was why he
had advertised for a full company. He anticipated that
it would run for years. Not that he expected to be able to
retain the original company all that time. Every part
was so splendid&mdash;practically all were star-parts&mdash;that the
artistes who had the good fortune to appear in them would
soon be tempted away from him by London managers.
Oh no, he hadn&#39;t written the drama himself. He only
wished he was sufficiently gifted. But he was very proud
to be able to acknowledge that it was, indeed, the fruit
of the genius of one of his family. Such an inspiring
subject. He had an intense admiration for Robert Burns.
Was Miss Stornway, indeed, not intimately acquainted
with the whole of that wonderful poet&#39;s works? Oh dear!
dear! That was distressing, and must be remedied.
She should be lent a book&mdash;several books. Mr. Sandy,
the great actor who was to play the title <i>rôle</i>, knew nearly
all Burns&#39;s poems by heart, and it was chiefly owing to his
appreciation of the acute study of the poet&#39;s character,
in &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard,&quot; that he had resolved to disappoint
several other managers in order to join this company.
The young lady who played &quot;Highland Mary,&quot; the heroine,
had not arrived yet. She lived in Northumberland. A
really excellent actress, only second to Ellen Terry. Mr.
Punter had gone to great expense to procure her services.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
Madame Cheape&mdash;not Sheep, my dear&mdash;was the &quot;Clarinda.&quot;
This spacious apartment had been retained especially
for rehearsals.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus he ran on, apparently in emulation of Tennyson&#39;s
brook, and Evarne had nothing to do but look intelligent,
and interpose a brief question occasionally to show that
she was attending.</p>

<p class="indent">He only ceased when the door opened to admit a little
woman who had approached unheard. The newcomer
was very pale, and looked fragile and subdued. Her thin
hair was drawn neatly behind her ears, her shabby black
gown hung in folds over her flat chest, and she slouched in
list slippers so many sizes too large that had she ventured
to lift her feet in walking, she would inevitably have
stepped out of her footgear, and left it behind her on the
floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah ha! Allow me to introduce my wife,&quot; said Mr.
Punter.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne rose and shook hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you like your part?&quot; was the salutation of
the lady of the house.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl discreetly avoided a direct answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has made me very anxious to hear the whole play.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately the little woman considered this response
as entirely satisfactory. She smiled complacently, and
commenced to nod her head so steadily, it appeared in
danger of becoming loosened.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Punter likewise seemed to swell with pride. At
length he could keep the great secret no longer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may as well tell you first as last, Miss Stornway. You
are now addressing the authoress of &#39;Caledonia&#39;s Bard.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was indeed taken aback at this piece of information.
Barely succeeding in suppressing a start, she
murmured something she fondly hoped was duly appropriate
to the occasion. Evidently she was successful, for
Mrs. Punter ceased nodding, and thanked her heartily.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
&quot;And now, where are you going to put up, my dear?&quot;
she inquired. &quot;Do you know Glasgow at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve never been here before, but I expect I can find
diggings easily enough. Rehearsals begin to-morrow,
don&#39;t they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that was what we expected,&quot; responded Mr.
Punter. &quot;But a few of the principals have not arrived
yet. Still, a short delay will enable you to become word-perfect
in your part, won&#39;t it? And that is so important.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes-s. But when does the tour open, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course that depends entirely on how the rehearsals
progress. Now, you must have something to eat before
you start house-hunting. You won&#39;t mind going into the
kitchen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Punter slouched on ahead, and Evarne followed to
another room at the rear of the house. This also was
practically devoid of furniture, but doubtless derived its
name from the small oil-stove that stood on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">The window looked out on to what had formerly been a
garden, but which now wore that melancholy and desolate
aspect that characterises a once well-tended spot that has
long been utterly neglected. The lawn was a field; the
flower-beds lost in weeds; the gravel walks overgrown;
boisterous winds had snapped the slender stem of a young
tree, which now lay wilted upon the ground. Altogether,
it was a scene in no way conducive to high spirits.</p>

<p class="indent">The authoress set about performing culinary operations
with a frying-pan and the oil-stove, and in due course a
repast was evolved of fried ham and stale bread. Evarne
found Mrs. Punter&#39;s skill at cookery on a par with the
estimate she had already formed of her literary gifts.
Eating heroically what she could, she rose to leave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But first I must introduce you to Charles Stuart,&quot;
declared Mr. Punter, who had joined them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Who is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does a little carpentering, and is to appear in the
drama. He is now painting the scenery.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
&quot;Useful man,&quot; thought the girl, and almost forgave him
for adopting such a <i>nom-de-théatre</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Wending their way to a tiny outhouse, they there found
this valuable personage busily occupied in mixing paint.
He turned round at their entry, and for the second time
that hour Evarne with difficulty suppressed a gasp. The
entire person of Charles Stuart, as far as could be seen,
was so covered with black hair that at first glance he
resembled a monkey. Quantities of fringe concealed his
forehead, falling even over his massive eyebrows. Although
quite young still, he not only had a heavy moustache,
but a beard and whiskers that lost themselves in
the thick mop covering his cranium, while his open shirt
displayed a chest like unto a doormat. As he transferred
the dripping paint-brush to his left hand and advanced
towards Evarne with his hairy right arm outstretched,
the girl felt rather like ignobly bolting away. What very
extraordinary people she had fallen amidst, to be sure!</p>

<p class="indent">But she stood her ground, and spoke to the man as if he
had been a natural-looking human being.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you painting now, Mr. Stuart? I should
like to see what you have done, if I may.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Show Miss Stornway what you are working at, Charlie,&quot;
suggested Mr. Punter, and as they all went out into the
garden he explained&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stuart was for years the head scene-painter at one of
the leading London theatres. You see, we mean to spare
no expense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne found herself wishing that she had not been
apparently the one exception in this determination concerning
lavish expenditure.</p>

<p class="indent">Hanging against the wall of the house were three scenes&mdash;one
a cottage interior, another a wild glen, and the third,
a rustic landscape, scarcely commenced.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to watch you work,&quot; she said. &quot;I paint
a little myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
&quot;Perhaps you would like to help, then?&quot; Mr. Punter
promptly suggested. &quot;All my sons work under Charlie.
Come to-morrow, and we will find you an apron and brushes
and see what you can manage to produce, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Laughingly, Evarne promised, and at length was allowed
to depart.</p>

<h2><a name="chXVIII" id="chXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<small>NEW TRIALS AND TROUBLES</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">After</span> some search she lighted on a really pleasant
room, clean and bright, at a rent of ten shillings
weekly. It possessed a true Scotch bed, built
into a cupboard in the wall. She had her box
conveyed from the station, and that night slept comfortably
enough in this curiously situated bed, in which confused
dreams of authoresses who inhabited ruins, and hairy men
who painted scenery in back gardens, appeared only an
appropriate accompaniment.</p>

<p class="indent">The next afternoon she wended her way to Sauchiehall
Street, and there made the acquaintance of Mr. Punter&#39;s
six sons, old and young&mdash;including Pat, the youth who
had first greeted her from the window. Then started
scene-painting. She undertook to do a cottage window,
draped with snowy muslin curtains. Pots of scarlet
geraniums stood on the sill, a big flour-bin was underneath,
while a green pasture with a lovely blue sky showed through
the open lattice. Her effort evoked ardent admiration
from the whole assembled Punter family. Indeed, Mrs.
Punter&#39;s gratitude was such that she impulsively invited
the artist in to tea.</p>

<p class="indent">Never had Evarne beheld such an extraordinary chamber
as that upstairs one into which&mdash;as a guest of the family&mdash;she
was now admitted. The first impression was of the
wildest confusion&mdash;house-moving, or spring-cleaning at
least. Here, as elsewhere throughout the house, the
windows were cracked and broken. In one corner was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
huge bed, covered with a grimy patchwork quilt. Boxes
stood around, some with open lids, others as yet uncorded,
while two large empty crates placed side by side and
covered with a cloth formed the table. There were several
chairs and stools, piles of dishes, cups and saucers of varied
hues and designs; some torn books, devoid of covers;
a number of men&#39;s hats and outdoor coats; and a baby&#39;s
cradle half-filled with potatoes.</p>

<p class="indent">The uncarpeted floor, on which lay a few small rugs,
was decorated likewise by a considerable number of stage
&quot;properties&quot; of many descriptions. The half-dozen large
plaster statues that stood around doubtless came under
this heading, but being all nude, they appeared indecently
incongruous amidst this domestic confusion and makeshift.
Evarne was now quite convinced that the Punters
were merely &quot;squatters&quot;&mdash;that they paid no rent, that
no public authority knew them to be here, that they had,
in fact, taken up their temporary abode in what was
really a deserted and supposedly uninhabitable house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve been grieving all the night that you&#39;ve not been
engaged to play &#39;Highland Mary,&#39;&quot; commenced Mrs. Punter,
after supplying her guest with tea. &quot;You&#39;re so verra
bonnie, just like what I imagine her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was somewhat flattered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you care to hear &#39;Mary&#39;s&#39; part?&quot; asked Mr. Punter,
and he then read aloud those scenes in which this damsel
appeared. Since she breathed her last in the second act,
and &quot;Clarinda&quot; then took her place as heroine, the <i>rôle</i> was
but brief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now read her the part of &#39;Jean Armour,&#39;&quot; said Mrs.
Punter, and the obedient husband started off again.</p>

<p class="indent">As he ceased, he looked inquiringly at Evarne over the
top of his spectacles.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl&#39;s genuine opinion was that never had she
listened to such utter twaddle in all her life. There did
not seem to be any plot at all, no vestige of even a central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
thread of continuous story. Yet more and more was
proudly read aloud, until at length nearly the whole
manuscript had been gone through. It was really immensely
funny, but, alas! this was quite unintentional.
Its creator laboured under the belief that she had produced
a poetical drama in blank verse, slightly bordering on a
tragedy!</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne felt cold depression steal over her as she listened.
Was it possible that such inane dulness would ever attract
the public? But, concealing her fears, she inquired in
respectful tones&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did it not take you a long time to write it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh dear me, no,&quot; was Mrs. Punter&#39;s lightly spoken
disclaimer. &quot;I just dictated it to my husband in odd
moments, while I&#39;d be bustling about getting dinner. It
was no trouble to me, I assure you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was on the tip of the girl&#39;s tongue to answer, &quot;I
thought not,&quot; but instinct whispered that such a supposition
might not fall quite prettily upon the authoress&#39;s
ears. Instead, she was just hypocrite enough to look as
impressed as she could have done had Shakespeare himself
stated a similar fact.</p>

<p class="indent">After this she rose to leave. Amiably enough they
insisted on lending her several books concerning the hero
of their drama; a volume of his poems, one called &quot;Burns&#39;s
Highland Mary,&quot; another entitled &quot;Burns&#39;s Chloris,&quot; and
yet another about his &quot;Clarinda.&quot; Evarne thought it
very unromantic and unpoetical of &quot;Bobbie&quot; to have
worshipped at the shrines of so many &quot;ladye-loves,&quot; but
was well pleased to be supplied with so much reading matter.</p>

<p class="indent">Still, while all this was very well in its way, it was not
business! Days passed. Mr. Sandy and &quot;Highland
Mary&quot; did not arrive, neither did Evarne see any of her
other fellow-artistes. As time went on and no rehearsal-call
was given, while the demands upon her purse were constant,
she commenced to make frequent and anxious inquiries.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
Mr. Punter was evidently as much concerned as she was
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it&#39;s no use my gathering the company together
here until Mr. Sandy has arrived. You must see that for
yourself. The whole play circles round him, as you know.
We must all wait a day or two longer. I admit I cannot
account for his unexplained neglect, and am much displeased.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne saw nothing for it but to be patient and make
the best of a bad job, but it was indeed a very seriously
bad job in her case. She had been prepared to find it
difficult to make her money last out until she received her
first week&#39;s salary, and this delay over even commencing
the rehearsals was really terrible.</p>

<p class="indent">She was lonely as well as anxious. She recommenced
sketching, studied Burns and his poems, stared in the
shop-windows, visited the Corporation Picture Gallery,
read in the Free Library. Despite all this, time hung
heavily on her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do the remainder of your company do?&quot; she
inquired of Mr. Punter one morning, on being informed,
as usual, that no news had been heard of Mr. Sandy.
She had that hour been forced to produce another half-sovereign
for her lodgings, and was seriously alarmed at
her situation. &quot;Are the others submitting to be kept
fooling around earning nothing and having to spend
money every day, as I am?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They realise that it&#39;s no fault of mine, Miss Stornway,&quot;
answered Mr. Punter severely, &quot;and they do not add to
my worries by reproaching me, even indirectly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all very well,&quot; retorted Evarne tartly. &quot;You
say most of them have homes in Glasgow. In that case
it&#39;s not the same expense for them that it is to me, and
they have their friends and families also, while I&#39;m alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As far as that goes, I&#39;ll tell you what I can do&mdash;yes,
and I will do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
This was stated with such an imposing and benevolent
air that Evarne waited expectant to hear in what manner
she was to be recompensed for this unjustifiable delay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I can quite do away with any trouble of that
nature. I shall give your address in Shamrock Street to
the very next of our lady artistes who calls here, and she
will doubtless come to see you. It is really too bad that
you should have no society.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s decidedly worse that I should have no work, and,
consequently no salary,&quot; retorted the girl as she turned
away.</p>

<p class="indent">The manager remembered his promise, for a couple of
days later Evarne&#39;s landlady announced that Miss Kennedy
had called from Mr. Punter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, show her in, and make tea for two, please,&quot; said
the girl, and a minute later the visitor entered.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a slender little creature, barely eighteen years
of age. In appearance she was one of those who seem to
have been manufactured in wholesale batches. Her figure
was practically identical with that of thousands of other
girls, and her countenance likewise had very little that
was at all distinctive. The grey eyes were&mdash;well, they
were what Miss Kennedy looked around the world with,
nothing more nor less! All her other features were equally
nondescript. Her light hair, much frizzled in front and
tied in a catagon behind, was neither dark nor fair, neither
thin nor ample. The little face was not unattractive, but
promised very average intelligence and no force of character.
She bore not the least likeness to the popular conception
of an actress. Her face was entirely free from the least
artificial aid to beauty, while her plain serge coat and
skirt, scarlet tam-o&#39;-shanter and black cotton gloves were
equally unpretentious.</p>

<p class="indent">As far as appearance went, she was in every way a
contrast to beautiful, stately Evarne, with her aristocratic
bearing, yet there was already a bond of sympathy between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
the two girls, and in less than five minutes they were
forming a kind of duet to complain of the perfidious behaviour
of the Punters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s really perfectly scandalous,&quot; declared Jessie
Kennedy. &quot;They promised me the rehearsals were to
begin ten days ago. They&#39;ve got no right to get their
company together&mdash;or almost together&mdash;like this, until
they were really going to make a start. And to bring you
all the way down from London too! I suppose they paid
your fare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, they did that, or I couldn&#39;t have come. Still,
it&#39;s a great shame. They must know people generally
can&#39;t afford to live in idleness like this. Yet what can
we do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I shall accept another engagement in a couple
of days if they don&#39;t begin, and so I shall tell them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What part have you got?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I understudy you, I believe, but otherwise I&#39;m not
actually in the play itself. I&#39;m the pianist. Of course,
we&#39;re only a &#39;fit-up,&#39; and don&#39;t have an orchestra, but I&#39;m
at the piano all the time between the acts, and I play soft
music during the love scenes, the death-beds, and the
visions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I should fancy you&#39;re kept very busy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, there is plenty for me to do, but I don&#39;t mind
that. I only want to start and do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder how the remainder of the company is taking
this miserable idleness? Do you know any of them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh yes; nearly all, more or less. One, Harry Douglas,
lives in my street, and he and I have done double turns
at music halls. He&#39;s got a voice like a seraph. He&#39;s
the most glorious tenor you ever heard. He&#39;s limes-man
in this company.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do we have limelight, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather, where &#39;Highland Mary&#39; appears as a vision,
and one or two other places.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
&quot;And what does Mr. Douglas think of it all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter so much to him. He&#39;s working in a
carpenter&#39;s shop until we start.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fancy! Can&#39;t he do a lot of things!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you should just hear him sing. Oh, my! It&#39;s
angels! It is really!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXIX" id="chXIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<small>NEW FRIENDS</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jessie Kennedy</span> turned out to be a very companionable
little person, and after this first interview
the two girls spent a good deal of time with
each other.</p>

<p class="indent">But the question of funds was of infinitely greater consequence
than any social intercourse, and with alarming
rapidity Evarne had arrived at the point when her resources
were no longer represented by even the smallest
gold coin of the realm. This thoroughly aroused her,
and the very next time she was again put off by excuses,
her usual gentleness was swept away beneath one of those
torrents of hot wrath that were a heritage from her mother.
Her beautiful dark eyes seemed to positively flash fire as
she fiercely declared that this sort of thing would have to
stop, that Mr. Punter&#39;s action in offering her this mock
engagement, and so preventing her from seeking genuine
work, was absolutely unjustifiable and infamous; that it
was not far short, if at all, from cheating and defrauding!
She concluded by hotly stating that if Mr. Sandy could not
or would not come, his part, in mere justice to others,
ought to be given at once to an actor who would take it.
She finished up by the statement that she was voicing the
opinion of others besides her own.</p>

<p class="indent">These words did not fall on barren ground. Mr. Punter
definitely settled on the evening of the following day for
the long-deferred first rehearsal, and further announced that
Mr. Sandy had now finally lost his splendid chance, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
Pat should go out immediately and telegraph for Mr.
Heathmore, an even better actor, whom he knew to be
anxiously longing for the opportunity of appearing in
&quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the strength of all this Evarne allowed herself to be
pacified, and was amiably willing to admit that perhaps
the real blame rested with the faithless Mr. Sandy alone.
Hereupon Mr. Punter had a suggestion to make.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My wife and I have been talking the matter over, and
we have decided to offer you&mdash;you, Miss Stornway&mdash;the
<i>rôle</i> of &#39;Highland Mary&#39; in place of that of &#39;Bess.&#39; It is
not a very long part, and you&#39;ll soon learn it. Your
remuneration then would be twenty-three and six in place
of a guinea. There now! Does not the notion appeal
to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; replied the girl dubiously. &quot;If you
could have told me sooner than the very day before the
rehearsals are at length to start&mdash;but there, if you give
me the script at once, I&#39;ll commence to study it. But
what about costumes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite simple! Mrs. Punter herself has resolved to
undertake the <i>rôle</i> of &#39;Jean Armour,&#39; so she will buy one
of your dresses for the purpose. She says the blue cotton
you showed her will serve nicely for you to wear when
you go to meet &#39;Burns&#39; in the glen, and with the money she
gives you for the other you can buy some white stuff and
make a robe that will do to die in, and likewise for the
vision.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I agree then, willingly. Who is to play &#39;Bess&#39;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We see no reason why Miss Kennedy should not
undertake that inferior part. Madame Cheape&mdash;our
&#39;Clarinda,&#39; you remember&mdash;will arrive in a day or so,
thus all the female <i>rôles</i> will be most satisfactorily filled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As Evarne walked back to Shamrock Street, she thought
somewhat ruefully that she had fallen among a very queer
and reckless&mdash;not to say shady&mdash;set of people. Everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
connected with them and their enterprise seemed a
matter of makeshifts. She could not help smiling to recall
the grandiose announcements printed at the head of the
official notepaper. &quot;Company of Star Artistes,&quot; indeed!
Fancy herself, then, never having yet set foot upon the
boards or spoken one word in public, being created leading
lady amid these universal stars! Still, it was such a silly
soft part in such a silly soft play she had to act, that she
was troubled by no apprehensions as to whether she was
sufficiently powerful, or emotional, or capable, or anything
else. She was fully convinced of her ability to rise to equal
heights with the other stars&mdash;at all events as far as those
constellations, Mrs. Punter and Jessie, were concerned.</p>

<p class="indent">The following evening, sure enough, rehearsals of a sort
did indeed commence. Mr. Heathmore was not forthcoming,
and &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard&quot; without &quot;Bobbie&quot; was
even worse than &quot;Hamlet&quot; without the &quot;Prince of Denmark.&quot;
Still, it was a comfort to make a start of any sort.</p>

<p class="indent">Jessie Kennedy at once brought up Harry Douglas, and
presented him to Miss Stornway. He was undertaking two
minor <i>rôles</i> in addition to managing the limelight and
helping to shift scenery, and within the first five minutes&#39;
conversation this all-round genius had incidentally remarked
that for several years he had been a professional lightweight
prize-fighter.</p>

<p class="indent">Two men&mdash;besides the ubiquitous &quot;Bobbie&quot;&mdash;had dialogue
parts with Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">Joe Harold&mdash;who played her stage father&mdash;she had
heard much of already. Jessie had procured him this
engagement, and had confided to her new friend that ere
the tour ended she hoped to have brought to pass another
engagement of a more romantic and lasting type. He
was absolutely the dearest boy alive, she declared. He
was a Jew, his real name being Joe Moses, but no one
would ever guess it. He hadn&#39;t got a hook nose, and he
would share his last penny with a pal. He had only one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
failing in the world, sometimes he took a &quot;wee drappie&quot;
too much to drink, but she would help him to conquer that
weakness. He was a commercial traveller, but, being out of
a job, had been pleased to join her in &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Montgomery&mdash;the stage doctor who had to aid
&quot;Bess&quot; to persuade &quot;Mary&quot; to die respectably in bed&mdash;had
great pretensions to good looks; moreover, he was
both tall and stalwart. But he was no more a professional
actor than the remainder of the company&mdash;as a rule he
earned his bread as a compositor.</p>

<p class="indent">There was, indeed, one taller than Montgomery, one
whose height numbered two or three inches over six feet,
but who paid for longitude by a painful meagreness. Archie&mdash;for
so Jessie called him&mdash;was, in very sooth, a protracted
tragedy. The son of a groom, he had been, until the age
of fifteen or thereabouts, the tiniest, lightest little chap
imaginable. Always amid horses, his one ambition was
to become a jockey, and he might have succeeded in attaining
this aspiration, had not cruel Nature taken it into her
head to make him grow! He had sprouted almost visibly,
beneath the horrified eyes of his horsey friends, and ere
he came to eighteen years had reached the proud&mdash;yet
hated&mdash;height of six feet three. Poor Archie&#39;s ambition
being thus hopelessly blighted, he had made no effort to
settle to any less fascinating career, but earned his daily
bread by doing more or less badly whatever came next to
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Of such consisted the &quot;star company&quot;! Evarne
deemed them all quite suitable individuals to be thus
secretly conglomerated in an empty room of a deserted
house hidden away behind a hoarding and seemingly
forgotten in the very heart of Glasgow. Strange fate
that had brought her to form one of the conspiracy!</p>

<p class="indent">The rehearsals now proceeded daily, Mr. Punter always
giving the cues of &quot;Burns&#39;s&quot; and &quot;Clarinda&#39;s&quot; parts. The
chief difficulty lay in remembering &quot;who was whom&quot; at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
any given moment. Without exception, all the men played
a couple of characters, in some cases even three separate
and distinct <i>rôles</i>. Mad-looking Charles Stuart appeared
as a prince and as &quot;Clarinda&#39;s&quot; footman&mdash;a proceeding that
appeared to Evarne as the height of absurdity. Charlie
swore he had no intention of visiting the barber, and no
one, having once seen that weird head above royal robes,
could possibly fail to recognise it again, even though the
appended body might, next time, chance to be clad in
servant&#39;s livery. They would at once discern the prince
in disguise in &quot;Clarinda&#39;s&quot; establishment, and would accordingly
look for intricacies of plot&mdash;doomed to be
disappointed.</p>

<p class="indent">If it had not all been really a matter of such serious
consequence to her, the girl would have spent her time
during these rehearsals in struggling with inopportune
laughter. As it was, her expression grew habitually more
and more serious as the conviction forced itself like unto a
barbed arrow into her brain: &quot;This play is to fail! It is
bound to fail! It can never succeed, never; and what can
I do then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the present, at all events, there was neither inaction
nor loneliness. She made the more intimate acquaintance
of Joe Harold and John Montgomery by inviting them,
together with Jess, to her lodging one evening for a little
private rehearsal of the death-bed scene. To her amusement
the men had purchased sausage-rolls, cakes and
ginger-beer from the shop round the corner, and the business
over, they produced these edibles and invited themselves
and their hostess to supper.</p>

<p class="indent">The unappetising topic that opened the meal was the
universal poverty that prevailed. All had been out of
work for some time, it appeared, and, like Evarne, were
subsisting painfully on a few paltry and fast-failing savings,
until the first week&#39;s salary from Mr. Punter should arrive
to relieve the situation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
It was the second time in her short career that Evarne
had been introduced into an absolutely fresh world. Live
and learn! Had the girl given her opinion a month ago,
it would probably have been to the effect that all commercial
travellers, compositors, and daughters of scene-shifters
(for this Jess owned had been her father&#39;s avocation
in life) were necessarily common and uneducated&mdash;even
though worthy enough folk. But there was very
little either in the speech or ways of her three humble
friends that could have appeared either absurd or offensive
to the most dainty lady in the land, while Mont, the printer,
was remarkably well-informed, handsome, and interesting.
Thus for so long, at all events, as Evarne and her commercial
traveller and her printer had mutual interests in
&quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard,&quot; she found them infinitely more congenial
than had been the majority of those men in the
higher walks of life whom Morris had presented to her.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, the nature of the society by which
she had been surrounded in those bygone days had, from
first to last, presented itself as one of the drawbacks of
her unfortunate position. Time&#39;s progress had, to some
considerable extent, blunted the keenness of her susceptibilities
in this direction. Still, she now found it passing
sweet to receive once again that vague indescribable
deference and respect that distinguishes so subtly&mdash;perchance
so unconsciously&mdash;a man&#39;s manner towards a
&quot;good&quot; woman, from that which he assumes to one whose
morals are understood to be &quot;easy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Yet more strongly did she experience a similar charm
in the society of Jessie. The young girl&mdash;&quot;who would
sooner marry Joe with all his faults and without a penny,
because she truly loved him, than marry a lord she didn&#39;t
care for&quot;&mdash;might not have been as witty, as merry, as
brightly amusing as some other women whom Evarne
could have named, but she was the first self-respecting
and respectable member of her own age and sex&mdash;save
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
Margaret&mdash;whom the girl had known since she left Heatherington.</p>

<p class="indent">Those years given to Morris&mdash;however brightened and
redeemed by her pouring forth the most disinterested and
sweetest affection&mdash;had been really very lonely&mdash;very
desolate. When she had first been thrown into contact
with the female associates that Morris&#39;s men
friends had been willing to introduce to her, she had
instinctively disliked and shrank from them, even
although she had been far too childishly innocent at
first to realise to the full the depravity of these
&quot;kept&quot; women.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in the days of her naïve ignorance of the real nature
of their purchased love&mdash;when the consciousness of her own
high impulses, combined with the all-embracing instinct
of charity in her disposition, had led her to attribute only
her own really beautiful motives and emotions to these
other women, who led lives outwardly corresponding to
her own&mdash;she, and they likewise, had felt that there was
really nothing in common between them. They belonged
to different worlds.</p>

<p class="indent">And even now, between Evarne and her lowly Scotch
friends&mdash;honest and agreeable though they might be&mdash;there
was still a barrier, that of caste, culture, habit. It
might be totally disregarded amongst them by common
consent, but was not thus easily annihilated. They were
of an entirely different station&mdash;of another stamp&mdash;from
the daughter of the refined Oxford student, with his lengthy
pedigree and old traditions. They and their equals could
never have entered thus intimately into her daily life had
she not been <i>déclassée</i>. In one way or another, Evarne
was indeed cut off from all open companionship with those
men&mdash;and especially those women&mdash;who would have been
really suited to one possessed of her training, her general
refinement, her personal character and nature. Had her
few brief years of love&#39;s happiness foredoomed her to lead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
for evermore the lonely life? Was it partly this that was
foreboded in the grim smile of Sekhet?</p>

<p class="indent">But as comrades the four amalgamated splendidly, and
at length the date on which the tour was to really start
was actually settled. Mr. Heathmore and Madame Cheape
were going direct from their homes to Ayr, since &quot;Bobbie&#39;s&quot;
birthplace was to have the honour of witnessing the first
performance of &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard.&quot; The other members
of the company were to leave Glasgow on Monday, rehearse
with &quot;Bobbie&quot; for the first time that same evening, and
open on Wednesday night.</p>

<h2><a name="chXX" id="chXX"></a>CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>REHEARSALS</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">But</span> before then Evarne was reduced to what was
indeed a harrowing necessity&mdash;a surreptitious
visit to the pawnshop. For some days ere this
she had been gradually eating less and less in a
despairing endeavour to hinder the steady lightening of
her purse. But even porridge and tea, bread and salt
butter, rice and brown sugar, however cheap, and alas!
correspondingly nasty, cost something.</p>

<p class="indent">One terrible morning, on returning from the day&#39;s
meagre shopping, she sat down to grapple with the fact
that all the money she possessed amounted to five pennies
and one farthing.</p>

<p class="indent">The only article of any value that she still owned was
her simple little enamel-cased watch.</p>

<p class="indent">The dire necessity of creeping into a pawnshop, to raise
money on her father&#39;s last gift, distressed the girl beyond
measure. She sat playing with the poor little thing, turning
it over and over tenderly in her hands, while tears of
mingled shame and grief gathered behind her eyelids. At
length she was learning the truly humiliating side of abject
poverty. She had asked Mr. Punter to advance a portion
of her first week&#39;s salary, and had been refused. Now,
not only was she terrified and appalled as she heard the
violent scratching of the gaunt wolf against her slender
shaking door, but abashed and mortified at what must be
done to ward off these cruel fangs yet a little longer.</p>

<p class="indent">However, she talked logic and practical common sense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
to herself, and after twilight had shrouded the city in a
kindly veil, sought out an establishment decorated by three
balls, and as unobtrusively as possible sneaked inside its
portals.</p>

<p class="indent">An old man behind the counter of the small cubby-hole
in which she found herself, looked at her watch and inquired
how much she wanted on it? She had half anticipated
being called upon to prove that it was legally hers,
but questions of any other nature were quite unexpected.
On the spur of the moment, fearful of asking too much,
she said softly, &quot;Twenty-five shillings, please.&quot; But
even at this the old man pouted out his lips for a minute,
then said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We couldna gie ye mair nor fifteen shillin&#39;s.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With the colour rising to her cheeks Evarne agreed,
whereupon her embarrassment was increased by the unlooked-for
fact of her name being demanded. With a half-sovereign
and five shillings in her purse, and her watch
represented by a horrible pawn-ticket, she slipped from
the shop, feeling relieved and degraded at the same time.</p>

<p class="indent">She clung to the idea of the ultimate success of &quot;Caledonia&#39;s
Bard&quot; with a tenacity that was pitiful. It must,
it should triumph! She dared not look onward and contemplate
what might be her lot if this unpromising venture
should indeed fail. The future had seemed black enough
while she still possessed a few pounds and one or two
trinkets. Now she had nothing&mdash;nothing!</p>

<p class="indent">On the company arriving at Ayr on Monday afternoon
they proceeded direct to the Drill Hall, where the &quot;fit-up&quot;
was to be erected. There&mdash;to the frank surprise of
some of the more incredulous&mdash;they actually discovered
both Mr. Heathmore and Madame Cheape awaiting them.
The parts of &quot;Burns&quot; and &quot;Clarinda&quot; were not, then,
to be undertaken at the last moment by Mr. Punter and
Evarne respectively, as had been whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">The girls were scarcely prepossessed by Madame Cheape.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
Evidently quite a middle-aged woman, she obviously
objected to this fact being known, and strove to conceal
it by the use of golden hair-dye and face powder, of which
quantity endeavoured to compensate for quality. This
very forgivable weakness in the lady&#39;s nature could have
been overlooked, but her affected airs and languid drawl
were, somehow, irritating in the last degree.</p>

<p class="indent">She inquired if Evarne and Jess were settled in &quot;diggings&quot;
yet, and suggested that all three should put up
together. The girls glanced questioningly at one another.
They had already arranged to divide expenses, and now,
on the score of further economy, agreed to the newcomer&#39;s
proposition.</p>

<p class="indent">And certainly, it was largely the business-like capacities
of Madame Cheape that enabled them to get rooms for
twelve-and-six the week for the three. For this sum they
were to have a sitting-room on the ground floor, a double-bedded
front and a small back bedroom upstairs. By
common consent Madame Cheape was accorded the privilege
of solitary grandeur.</p>

<p class="indent">The house stood in an eminently respectable street, one
end of which opened on to the banks of a canal. The
sitting-room was really quite pretty, with clean curtains,
pictures, and cheerful coloured cushions. Moreover, in
the corner stood a piano, its brightly-polished candle-holders
and embroidered key-cover suggesting that it was
the pride of its owner&#39;s heart.</p>

<p class="indent">That evening took place what had promised to be the
first real rehearsal, but lo! it seemed totally impossible to
get a full cast together. &quot;Clarinda&quot; and &quot;Burns&quot; were
on hand now, sure enough, but that much-needed personage,
Charles Stuart&mdash;scene painter and shifter&mdash;prince
and footman&mdash;had run away! He added insult to injury
by leaving a message that he was &quot;safely out of it,&quot; and
&quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard&quot; knew him no more.</p>

<p class="indent">His mantle descended upon two of Mr. Punter&#39;s sons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
who donned it reluctantly enough. These lads, Pat and
Billie, nervous gawks of seventeen and nineteen, were both
seemingly of such timorous dispositions as to be unable
to speak above a whisper. The lost Charlie had roared
his words like the Bull of Bashan. He would have been
audible, at all events.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Heathmore repeatedly assured everyone that he had
only received his script that Saturday. Since some of
the scenes consisted almost entirely of soliloquies on Burns&#39;s
part, and since the poet, even in casual conversation, had
a little way of giving utterance to speeches of over a page
in length, poor Mr. Heathmore was still far from having
committed the part to memory. He unblushingly carried
the voluminous script in his hand as he acted, but held out
hopes of knowing it pretty well by the fateful Wednesday
night. But if he really believed this himself, no one
else shared his confidence on the point.</p>

<p class="indent">Even had the performance been a fortnight instead of a
couple of days ahead, the company would have appeared
in a hopelessly backward and muddled state. Dismay
was universal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is no ordinary theatrical concern, is it?&quot; inquired
Evarne despondently, and thereby aroused a regular
storm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heavens, no! It&#39;s a howling swindle! Ayr will probably
see the beginning and the end of the whole idiotic
show.&quot; All agreed that the play itself was a bit of rubbish,
the management a regular humbugging affair, and the
prospects of the tour&mdash;nil!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do let&#39;s work hard, though. Do let&#39;s make it a success
if we can,&quot; begged poor Evarne, but indeed no one stood
in need of any such prompting. All would willingly have
rehearsed from morning to night, but Mr. Heathmore
insisted on being left in peace on Tuesday afternoon to
try to master at least some of his endless part. Thus the
remainder of the company were at liberty to visit Burns&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
Cottage, the Kirk o&#39; Alloway, and to wander along &quot;Ye
banks and braes o&#39; Bonnie Doon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the evening, after another rehearsal, the girls held a
reception and supper-party in their sitting-room. It was
not a wild extravagance&mdash;indeed rather an economy&mdash;though
maybe there was something of &quot;eat, drink and be
merry, for to-morrow we die,&quot; in the feeling that prompted
it. The supper was a joint-stock affair; everyone who was
invited was in the same breath likewise asked to produce
fourpence towards the banquet. Jess expended the fund
of three shillings thus raised on bread and cheese, honest
unpretentious beer, a monstrous hot rice pudding with
jam sauce, mixed biscuits and a couple of bunches of
watercress. All the shareholders were fully satisfied,
and united in a vote of thanks to the caterer.</p>

<p class="indent">After supper an impromptu concert was organised.
Everyone was able to contribute to the general entertainment,
save Evarne herself, and Pat and Billie Punter,
whom nobody heeded. But Evarne fulfilled her share of
social duties by presiding over all, and surely never had
such a gracious and tactful young hostess held sway over
such a strangely mixed gathering.</p>

<p class="indent">The piano&mdash;the well-tuned, well-polished piano&mdash;was
an immense assistance. Mont sang, Jessie played, and
Douglas was enabled to show off his much-belauded tenor
notes. And exquisite they were, in sooth&mdash;those tender,
heart-stirring and dulcet strains. It was indeed a glorious
singing-bird that was confined in this ex-prize fighter&#39;s throat.</p>

<p class="indent">The hostess&#39;s only trouble was Madame Cheape. That
languid individual had spent the afternoon with the landlady,
Mrs. Sargeant, and the evening likewise, presumably,
for she had not turned up at the seven o&#39;clock rehearsal.</p>

<p class="indent">And alack! this protracted confabulation had very
evidently not been carried on without the aid of a certain
amount of liquid refreshment&mdash;and that, too, of a more
exhilarating nature than mere tea. Thus, after a bumper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
of beer at supper, the sentiment of the tenor&#39;s love-songs
proved too trying. The final strains of &quot;Sweet Géneviève&quot;
were still lingering on the air, when the hush that
Douglas&#39;s enchanted notes evoked was ruthlessly broken
in upon by Madame Cheape. She proclaimed that they
were all getting &quot;a confounded sight too solemn,&quot; and
that she would liven them up with a dance. Thereupon the
poor old thing, seizing her skirts, proceeded to &quot;liven them
up a bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jess, who was seated at the piano, promptly strummed a
merry dance-tune, and all laughed to watch Madame
Cheape&#39;s absurd caperings. There had been a time when
Evarne would immediately have been outraged by the
painful spectacle, but now, to behold a half-drunken
woman providing merriment for a roomful of men was no
longer strange or instantly repulsive. She laughed too,
until she suddenly realised that she had been enabled to
discover that Madame Cheape wore red garters, and remembered
that she was in the society of presumably
respectable men.</p>

<p class="indent">She became scandalised, and, springing to her feet, called,
to Jess to cease playing at once. Then, since the dancing
was continued with renewed vigour to compensate for the
absence of music, Evarne laid her hands on the shoulders
of the skittish performer, and suggested that &quot;Clarinda&quot;
should retire and have a nice long night in readiness for
the morrow. But dear &quot;Clarinda,&quot; not being taken by
this notion, declined to act upon it. She hadn&#39;t nearly
done her dance yet. Let Miss Stornway be off to bed herself.
But Evarne was determined to get the intoxicated
woman out of the room, and rapidly crossing to the door,
flung it open as a preliminary to bringing &quot;gentle strength&quot;
to reinforce her wise advice.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside a surprise awaited Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">She found herself face to face with the flabbergasted
Mrs. Sargeant, who was standing on the doormat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
&quot;You were just coming in, I suppose?&quot; inquired
Evarne politely.</p>

<p class="indent">The landlady stammered, and at length confessed that
she had been listening. But her explanation made the
action appear forgivable&mdash;even touching. Her son was
a sailor, she said; he used to sing &quot;Sweet Géneviève,&quot; and
until this evening she had not heard it since he went
away to sea.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne believed her, and was moved to sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Would you very much like to hear it again?&quot; she
asked. &quot;I&#39;m sure Mr. Douglas won&#39;t mind repeating it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gratefully the woman entered the room and stood by
the piano, her eyes fixed on the singer, as once more his
exquisite notes sweetened the air. Then, full of thanks,
she went out, taking the unsentimental Madame Cheape
with her, and ere long the party broke up.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXI" id="chXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>THE CAREER OF &quot;CALEDONIA&#39;S BARD&quot;</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At</span> length the feared and fateful Wednesday dawned.
The morning was devoted to a final rehearsal that
only left everyone more confused&mdash;more hopeless&mdash;than
ever. Not a solitary actor was word-perfect
in all the <i>rôles</i> that fell to his share. Evarne and
Jess, with a single part apiece, were the most promising,
but both were absolutely inexperienced, and now rather
frightened.</p>

<p class="indent">In the afternoon the actors erected the &quot;fit-up,&quot; under
the supervision of Brown, the baggage-man, while the
girls looked on and encouraged their struggles. Evarne,
who had only that very morning been able to get the
money for her brown costume from Mrs. Punter, had
spent it on white butter-muslin for the &quot;vision&quot; gown.
She now sat hastily stitching away at the interminable,
seams of a flowing, snowy, shroud-like garment, whilst
Madame Cheape&mdash;sober again&mdash;poured into her presumably
maiden ear lamentations concerning the woes of
married life.</p>

<p class="indent">By the evening, the whole company was in a state of
irritable nervousness and apprehension. They ate what
tea they could&mdash;and in some cases that implied what they
were able to get&mdash;and were all gathered in the hall, with
ample time not only to dress, but to stand around in knots,
conversing in ominous whispers. Archie, the soured,
even went so far as to assert that they were all very likely
to be lynched by an infuriated public.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
It was difficult to avoid some feelings of sympathy with
poor old Mrs. Punter, as she handed each member of the
company a leaf from some species of herb, which she
confidently declared would bring them luck. She also
made it understood that she was going to celebrate the
first night by standing drinks all round, and solemnly
wrote down on a slip of paper each individual&#39;s fancy in
this direction.</p>

<p class="indent">This did something towards producing a more universally
good-natured state of mind, but the reaction was sudden
and disgust loud and undisguised, when&mdash;after the elaborate
ceremony of putting everyone&#39;s wishes into writing
and duly receiving their thanks&mdash;all that did verily make
its appearance was one bottle of lemonade&mdash;small size!</p>

<p class="indent">And the performance! A fiasco had been anticipated,
but it proved to be even worse than the wildest nightmare
had pictured. Evarne really did know her part, and had
rehearsed her dying scene with Mont and Jess until they
presented it&mdash;or so they flattered themselves&mdash;in a manner
that would cause it to come as a refreshing little oasis in
the midst of the evening&#39;s confusion. But to rehearse
in private and to appear in public are two different matters.
Jess repeatedly forgot her words, and would then unblushingly
demand in loud, flurried whispers, &quot;What&#39;s
next, for Heaven&#39;s sake?&quot; That was bad enough, but
Mont was far worse. He not only forgot his <i>rôle</i> as completely
as if he had never learned it, but seemingly every
other word but one in the whole Scottish language likewise.</p>

<p class="indent">At all events, what he did whenever wild glances from
both girls told him that he had got to say something or
other, was to repeat over and over again a phrase that
sounded like &quot;She&#39;s champing, she&#39;s champing.&quot; Evarne
felt really angry at his stupidity in describing her as if she
had been a fretful mare instead of a dying maiden. Finally,
it dawned on her perception that this imbecile doctor was
holding out hope to the weeping friends around her couch&mdash;assuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
them that the patient was &quot;champion&quot;!&mdash;Scotch
for &quot;in excellent health.&quot; What a monstrous lack
of resource on Mont&#39;s part, when he knew right well that
the curtain descended on the touching demise of this
damsel whom he persisted in describing as &quot;champion&quot;!</p>

<p class="indent">As to poor &quot;Highland Mary&quot; herself, she was utterly
tricked and sold. Where were all the graceful gestures
to the perfecting of which so much practice had been
devoted? Where those truly dramatic attempts to
spring from the bed with outstretched arms, as beauteous
visions assailed her dying eyes? Where the pathetic
leaning over to one side to gently stroke the bent head of
the weeping &quot;Bess&quot;? Where all those sweet and realistic
little touches which were to have brought tears to the eyes of
even a bored and irate audience? All impossible! Out
of the question! Had investigation been made, the
luckless &quot;Mary&quot; would have been found to be breathing
out her last sigh upon a couple of chairs laid over on their
sides, with two tin bonnet-boxes between them to render
this makeshift couch sufficiently long.</p>

<p class="indent">As it was, her toes projected over the end of the lowest
chair, while she suffered such anguish from knobs and
spikes that it composed a mild form of torture. Yet whenever
she dared to so much as wriggle, the tin-boxes creaked
loudly, while had she attempted to gain genuine relief by
actually shifting from her first position&mdash;had she not lain
absolutely motionless, propped up on one elbow, which
soon ached to distraction&mdash;tragedy would have been turned
to comedy with a vengeance. Those rickety chairs would
assuredly have over-tipped, and the audience would have
beheld &quot;Mary&quot; and her improvised couch rolling pell-mell
together down to the footlights.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Heathmore started by explaining to the audience
that his part had been sent to him too late to be possibly
learnt; then he undisguisedly proceeded to read it. In
the &quot;glen scene&quot; Evarne found it truly disconcerting to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
have to stand throughout these endless love-speeches, her
waist tenderly encircled by &quot;Burns&#39;s&quot; arm sure enough,
but with his head all the time turned right away from her
in order to gaze on the script that he held in his other
hand. As to the rest of the drama, she never had been
able to learn properly who was whom, or what they were all
up to, and even the first public performance threw no
light on the puzzle.</p>

<p class="indent">The play was proceeded with to the bitter end, but a
mere sprinkling of spectators remained to the finish.
Quite early in the evening the quieter members of the disgusted
audience had, in severe silence, left the hall. The
more rowdy element remained to get what return they
could for their money by hooting, cat-calling, whistling and
shouting.</p>

<p class="indent">Jess stuck to her post at the hired piano, and played
away heroically throughout the protracted intervals
between the acts. The young girl was quite admirable,
sitting alone amidst the defrauded audience, strumming
away dauntlessly, regardless of the nutshells thrown at her,
and the jeers and ribald questions by which she was assailed.</p>

<p class="indent">All the performers at least were heartily thankful when
the miserable show was over for the night, and midst
many &quot;swear words&quot; from the men and plaintive deep-breathed
&quot;Sh&#39;s!&quot; from the girls, they wended their ways
to their respective lodgings.</p>

<p class="indent">And next evening it all had to be gone through once
more, and this time the supply of audience was strictly
limited. It might be owing to the rain, which was descending
in a steady Scotch drizzle. But the despondent
mummers had a shrewd suspicion that the truth concerning
&quot;P. Punter&#39;s Magnificent Co.&quot; had spread throughout the
length and breadth of Ayr. It was not merely the dejection
caused by the snub expressed by the rows of empty
benches that brought such frowns upon usually placid
brows. The abject poverty prevailing in the company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
was universal. Several of the young people were almost
penniless, and made no secret of their destitute condition.
So a deputation had waited upon the manager that afternoon
to &quot;protest,&quot; or &quot;kick up a righteous row,&quot; as they
put it&mdash;to &quot;try to get the breeks off a Hielander,&quot; according
to Mr. Punter&#39;s version. In plain words, there was a
general demand that, in consideration of the long delay
for rehearsals, a portion of the company&#39;s salary should be
now paid in advance&mdash;at least sufficient to buy bread and
cheese until the end of the week. After much argument,
appeals, and threats, Mr. Punter had been brought to
promise that the takings on that evening should be divided
amidst the company after the show. Thus the tiny
audience was a truly serious matter.</p>

<p class="indent">The second cause for anxious frownings was the statement
of Archie that the eldest Punter boy had been overheard
to tell the girl behind the bar in the &quot;Ass and the
Thistle,&quot; that the company was to be disbanded at the
close of the three days at Ayr. No hint of this had been
officially given, but it seemed so highly probable that it
was generally accepted for fact. Evarne dared not contemplate
it. The sorrows of the past seemed already years
behind her, overlaid by the painful excitement and interest
of the present, and sick anxiety and apprehension concerning
the grey-shrouded future.</p>

<p class="indent">A little innovation was introduced that evening that
certainly made things run smoother. Jess not only played
in the intervals, but lifted up her voice and sang old familiar
Scottish ballads. This was immediately popular. The
audience joined in the chorus of some, and applauded
all. Jess sang until her throat must have ached, and was
undoubtedly the success of the evening.</p>

<p class="indent">After the &quot;rag&quot; had fallen for the last time, the audience
dispersed howling, booing and hissing, out into the rain.
Then the company gathered expectant around Mr. Punter,
who accordingly handed out some coins. It was but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
small sums that he distributed, but it was something to
go on with, and Evarne and Jessie came off far best of all
with four shillings apiece.</p>

<p class="indent">By Friday morning the girls at least felt too abashed to
willingly show themselves in the streets of Ayr. But
another rehearsal call had been given for eleven o&#39;clock&mdash;which
at least sounded encouraging&mdash;so exhorting one
another to be defiant and brazen, they wended their way
towards the hall. As they neared it, Jess suddenly stood
still, and clutched Evarne&#39;s arm. Three men had appeared
from out the building, staggering beneath the weight of a
piano. This they placed on a cart, carefully covered it
with oil-skins, and drove away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh my! is that my piano gone?&quot; gasped the little
songstress. Impossible that their resource&mdash;their stand-by&mdash;should
have been thus filched from them! Yet so it
was. The owner of the piano, it seemed, had been present
on the previous evening, and being perchance a prophet
and able to foresee the future, had taken time by the forelock
and demanded in advance the money due for the hire
of his instrument. A quarrel with Mr. Punter had resulted,
which ended by the man ruthlessly removing his piano.</p>

<p class="indent">Jessie particularly was in a fine state of distress: with
her it was a case of &quot;Othello&#39;s occupation&#39;s gone,&quot; and
her complaints and lamentations rang loud. &quot;Caledonia&#39;s
Bard&quot; unrelieved by music! Terrible! At length,
Heaven bestowed an inspiration upon the troubled Jessie.
What about Mrs. Sargeant&#39;s piano? Surely if Harry
Douglas went and asked for its loan, making a personal
favour of the matter, he might succeed. If Mrs. Sargeant
at first declined, and he forthwith broke out into the
strains of &quot;Sweet Géneviève,&quot; would he not be irresistible?
Anyway, for goodness&#39; sake let it be tried.</p>

<p class="indent">Procuring a trolley, and accompanied by Brown, the
heroic Douglas set out upon this venture. In less than
half an hour they returned. Wonder and delight! then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
efforts of the modern Orpheus had been crowned with
success. He had sung &quot;Sweet Géneviève,&quot; and had
thereby charmed either Mrs. Sargeant or her piano. Here
it was! he stood by it smiling&mdash;proud and happy singer!</p>

<p class="indent">All that day it poured with rain. It was now the
evening of the last performance of &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard&quot; at
Ayr. What were Mr. Punter&#39;s arrangements for the
morrow? So far he had given no clue. The weather
added to the general depression; none ventured out into
the downpour, but as twilight fell the figures of the actors
and actresses, huddled under umbrellas, might be seen
approaching the hall from various directions.</p>

<p class="indent">The conjectures, the suggestions, the hopes, the fears
discussed in the dressing-rooms were of far greater interest
to the members of the company than was the play itself.
The time they spent on the stage&mdash;far from appearing
in the light of the most important moments of the evening&mdash;seemed
but breaks into the far more serious and enthralling
&quot;Drama of Reality&quot; in which all were taking part.</p>

<p class="indent">It was now a generally known secret that Mr. Punter
was unable to pay the nine pounds owing for the hire of the
hall. Halfway through the evening it was further spread
around&mdash;in mysterious murmurs and with bated breath&mdash;that
the instant the curtain fell for the last time everyone
must be prepared to look after themselves&mdash;their own
interests&mdash;and, as far as possible, those of Mr. Punter.
All were to promptly seize on their respective belongings
for fear they might be claimed by the officials of the hall;
the &quot;fit-up&quot; was to be rushed down&mdash;on the morrow all
were returning to Glasgow, where more prosperous arrangements
would be made for the future.</p>

<p class="indent">But this programme of events, even if originating in Mr.
Punter&#39;s brain, was not destined to enjoy his co-operation.
Suddenly Joe startled the girls by dashing almost without
warning into their dressing-room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s gone&mdash;he&#39;s off&mdash;the blaggard!&quot; he shouted.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
&quot;Who? Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, that vile Punter. Somebody from the station
has come and told Brown. Him and Mrs. Punter and the
kids caught the five-to-ten to Glasgow. He was off with
all the cash while we were finishing acting his rotten play!
He&#39;s given us the slip, left us in the lurch without our
salary! Got clean away with all the rest of the takings,
such as they are!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both the girls gasped, and Evarne, homeless, friendless,
with exactly five-and-twopence in the world, turned pale.
A moment later, a sudden uproar on the stage caused them
to both rush out excitedly. There, surrounded by irate
actors and stage-hands, stood&mdash;or rather huddled together&mdash;Pat
and Billie Punter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ve got them, anyway!&quot; shouted Brown.
&quot;They&#39;ll have to pay something for their pa!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Before any further threats could be either uttered or
put into action, two men appeared in the entrance, closing
dripping umbrellas, and with countenances as lowering as
the weather without. They were the respective owners of
the Drill Hall and of the hired piano. The latter strode
straight up the gangway to the Punters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, you young thieving varmints. Where&#39;s my
money for the two evenings you had my piano? Five-and-six
a night, and three shillings for transport. I&#39;ll
just thank you to hand over fourteen shillings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afeared&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Pat was commencing feebly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No jaw! Hand over my fourteen shillings,&quot; repeated
the man.</p>

<p class="indent">Pat accordingly remained silent, and fumbled in his
pocket. The piano-owner&#39;s brow cleared somewhat, but
only to cloud afresh as the youth merely produced his
father&#39;s visiting-card.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you&#39;ll take this,&quot; faltered Pat, offering the piece of
pasteboard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! D&#39;you think that&#39;s good enough! You and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
your visiting-card be&mdash;&mdash;&quot; the irate creditor was beginning,
when the owner of the hall interposed&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here. I shall pay you this fourteen shillings
out of my own pocket, and for my security I will retain
possession of everything now in the place. Do you all
understand?&quot;&mdash;and he glanced sternly round at the
assembled company. &quot;You&#39;re at liberty to take yourselves
off&mdash;the sooner the better&mdash;but if any of you attempt to
remove any properties&mdash;yes, I mean either stage-truck, or
what you choose to call your own&mdash;I will have in the police.
Understand that now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His listeners returned him no response, but unobtrusively
wandered off to their respective dressing-rooms. Forewarned,
everybody had practically completed their packing,
and now the owner of the hall, penetrating behind the
scenes, discovered the entire company to be fastening
straps and hastily cramming various objects of one sort
and another into pockets or blouses. Bags and boxes
were vanishing with various figures who were drifting
away towards the front entrance&mdash;striving to render
themselves as small and insignificant as possible&mdash;yet
departing with all good speed. In an instant he had
made up his mind. He whispered to one of his satellites,
and in half a minute all the gas was turned off, plunging
the whole place into inky blackness.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was in the act of fastening the padlock to the
end of the long metal rod of her basket, when this darkness
as of Erebus suddenly descended. Finishing her task,
she was groping her way between chairs and boxes to where
she imagined the door to be, when she heard the welcome
sound of Mont&#39;s voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you here, Miss Stornway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, quite lost. What has happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s done it on purpose. Here, Brown, strike that
match now. Quickly, which is your box? We will
carry it out for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
The last match they owned between them flared and
died out, and in the darkness the three groped their way
from the hall. Evarne went ahead and tried to clear
the track as best she could, but all stumbled and lurched
against overturned chairs, and tripped over articles dropped
in the hasty escape of those who had preceded them.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXII" id="chXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<small>POVERTY MAKES ONE ACQUAINTED WITH</small><br />
<small>STRANGE BEDFELLOWS</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Setting</span> down the basket at the corner of a
neighbouring street, the men went back to see
what else could be thus rescued. Evarne sat
on her box and waited. Her umbrella was lost.
The rain was still pouring down steadily, persistently;
along the gutters the water rushed in torrents, the skies
and the earth were alike enveloped in damp obscurity.
No living being appeared; indeed, practically the only
sign of the existence of mankind was the feeble jet of
the street lamp, which reflected its gleam in the wet pavement
as in a lake.</p>

<p class="indent">So long did the girl wait, that, despite the discomfort
of her unique situation, she fell into a sort of vague reverie,
and a curious feeling of abstraction from her own personality
crept over her. Was it really she indeed&mdash;Evarne
Stornway&mdash;who was out here in the middle of the night
in this drenching rain, seated in solitary misery upon the
box containing all her worldly possessions, at some unknown
street corner of a small town in Scotland? Unreasonably
enough, it appealed to her as a most extraordinary thing
that <i>she</i> should be the individual chosen out of all humanity
to be thus strangely circumstanced this night.</p>

<p class="indent">She was aroused by hearing her name shouted in the
distance. In response to her answering call a couple of
figures appeared, and Mont&#39;s voice said&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
&quot;Couldn&#39;t find this blessed corner again in the mist.
Jess has sent down a message that she&#39;s gone to supper
with Joe, and will you come too? You had better.
There&#39;s always a nice fire there of an evening, and you look
soaked through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I only look what I am, then. Certainly I&#39;ll go, if Jess
is there. What about my box?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brown and I will carry it round to Mrs. Sargeant&#39;s and
tell her you&#39;ll both be late. Do you know your way to
our diggings?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know where I am now, one bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mont explained, and Evarne accordingly hurried off
through the downpour.</p>

<p class="indent">On reaching her destination she was received with
cheers. Most of the company seemed gathered in Mrs.
Shiells&#39;s kitchen. The house itself was let out in tenements,
and theatrical lodgings were obtainable on practically
every floor. Thus all the actors were residing in the
one building, and the kitchen of good-natured Mrs. Shiells
was the general rendezvous.</p>

<p class="indent">In due course Mont and Brown returned, and with them
came news of fresh complications. Madame Cheape had
gone! She had been back to her room, packed up all her
belongings and taken them with her, leaving behind only
the assurance that the other young ladies had the money
for her rent. Mrs. Sargeant had evidently been drinking
again, but not to the point of forgetting the piano. It
belonged to her daughter, it seemed; it had been lent
without its lawful owner&#39;s leave, and if it was not in its
place when that daughter returned at eleven, Mrs. Sargeant
contemplated being half-slaughtered by her offspring,
whose temper, when aroused, she described as &quot;enough
to make the &#39;air stand up on your &#39;ead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh dear! I forgot the piano,&quot; faltered Jess.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tried to get it out, I swear I did,&quot; avowed Douglas.
&quot;The owner of the hall made two men sit on it until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
door was locked. He&#39;s going to keep it in pawn until he
gets his nine pounds fourteen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Madame Cheape never gave us any money, did
she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not one farthing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A grim silence prevailed. How were they to face this
terrible Miss Sargeant? One of the lodgers and the piano,
both departed&mdash;flitted away!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I advise this,&quot; said Archie ultimately. &quot;Let Miss
Stornway&#39;s basket be brought round here, and you girls
go and pack up all your other belongings and bring them
along too. Then each pay Mrs. Sargeant your respective
shares of the rent you had all agreed upon&mdash;twelve-and-six,
wasn&#39;t it? That&#39;s four and twopence each. Tell her old
Cheape has sloped, but that the piano is all right, and will
come home sooner or later. Then if she still chooses to
kick up a row, she can&#39;t stick to any of your props, that&#39;s
one thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We really oughtn&#39;t to be expected to suffer for either
the Cheape&#39;s or the Punter&#39;s tricks, ought we?&quot; demanded
Jess, and so Archie&#39;s plan of campaign was adopted.</p>

<p class="indent">The interview passed off quite easily. The terrible
Miss Sargeant had not yet returned; the old woman
accepted their eight-and-fourpence without demur, and
a blouse that Madame Cheape had overlooked as a substitute
for the remaining four-and-twopence. Both girls
united in assuring her that the precious piano was in safe
keeping, and that she was to impress this fact upon her
daughter.</p>

<p class="indent">They then hastened back to Mrs. Shiells&#39;s warm, cosy
kitchen, feasted on hot broth and discussed the desperate
state of affairs. At last it became needful to return to
their own cheerless rooms to sleep. The men in a group
escorted them through the dark, deserted roads. But
Archie was in a thoroughly furious temper, and Douglas
was never a sucking dove. As the group stood for a final
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
chat in the street outside Mrs. Sargeant&#39;s house, these two,
from angry disputing, set to work to settle their differences
of opinion by seeing who could hit hardest.</p>

<p class="indent">A general uproar resulted, starting peaceful Ayr from its
first slumbers. All along the street, upper windows were
flung open, and heads appeared, startled or curious. Suddenly
yet another sound was clearly heard above all the
confusion&mdash;the angry bang of a door, the sharp turning of
a key, and the drawing of bolts. The girls were locked out!</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden hush descended, and for a moment everyone
stood spellbound. Then Evarne quickly sped across the
street, and banged with the knocker again and again. The
only response took the form of a young woman appearing
at an upper window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You folk don&#39;t seem to know that we keep a respectable
house,&quot; she cried. &quot;We are not going to have females
here who don&#39;t know how to behave themselves, and who
are thieves into the bargain. If you get over ma, who&#39;s a
fool, and come stealing my piano&mdash;my piano, what I paid
for myself&mdash;well, if ma lets herself be sucked in by a lot of
sneaking scoundrels like you are, all of you, I tell you
straight out we&#39;re not going to have women here who brawl
in the streets in the middle of the night, as well as steal
pianos; so you can take yourselves off, and if either of you
two, who call yourselves ladies I dare say, show your noses
here again, I&#39;ll have you clapped into prison for stealing a
respectable woman&#39;s piano. You needn&#39;t think you&#39;re
going to sleep beneath this roof to-night, so be off with you,
piano thieves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here she banged down the window with such violence
that the glass rattled in the casement. Dead silence prevailed
in the street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; faltered Douglas, quite subdued. &quot;It&#39;s
all my fault from beginning to end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s no use standing here, I suppose,&quot; declared
Evarne in rather a shaking voice. &quot;Come along, Jess;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
we&#39;ll go back to Mrs. Shiells and see what she can do for us.
I&#39;m sure she will let us sit in her kitchen till morning,
anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Archie and I will give up our bed,&quot; cried remorseful
Douglas, as the glum little procession, under the gauntlet
of many eyes, turned to retrace its steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a bad, wicked creature to shut us out in the
streets at this time of night,&quot; declared Jess with emphasis,
then sniffed, suspiciously close to tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t cry till you see the end of it,&quot; advised Evarne,
stoical from very misery. &quot;How can we know whether it
be good or bad angels that have planned all these unforeseen
events? Anything that appears to be entirely hateful&mdash;like
this whole evening has been&mdash;may be but a preliminary
to happiness!&quot; But her heart was as heavy as lead as
she spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness gracious me! What a queer girl you are
to talk like a minister in his pulpit while we are sloshing
through the mud and the rain with nowhere to sleep!&quot;
laughed Jess, highly amused; whereupon Evarne smilingly
inquired what more appropriate moment could be chosen.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Shiells was kindness itself. Surely, she would find
a haven for the puir lassies, she declared. Let them wait
a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">After a brief absence she returned, accompanied by
another brawny Scotch dame. She had believed Miss
Brodie here had a vacant room, she said, but she was mistaken.
However, it was nigh two o&#39;clock. There wasn&#39;t
much more of the night before them. She&#39;d be pleased
if one of the lassies would share her bed, and would the
other sleep with Miss Brodie?</p>

<p class="indent">Gratefully the girls accepted this offer. It was arranged
that Jess should stay with Mrs. Shiells, and in less than a
quarter of an hour Evarne found herself lying in the darkness
by the side of this new good Samaritan who had so
recently appeared upon the scene.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXIII" id="chXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<small>A FRESH TURNING</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Miss Brodie</span> had apologised for not having a
spare bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it had been the morn&#39;s nicht, noo,&quot; she
explained. &quot;I&#39;ve got ma sister frae Lunnon
stoppin&#39; wi&#39; me, she&#39;s in the only vacant room, but she&#39;ll
be awa&#39; again the morn.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Evarne emphatically declared that she did
not envy the sister the spare room one jot, and soon after
this they composed themselves to rest.</p>

<p class="indent">But Evarne wooed sleep in vain. In silence and darkness
and strangeness; the excitement of the evening, with
its sustaining power all past; the company finally disbanded
and deserted; everything chaos for the present&mdash;and
for the morrow&mdash;&mdash;? She had now a shilling and a
halfpenny left in the world. Supposing she pawned some
of her garments, and thus got back to Glasgow, wherein had
she at all bettered her position? What could she do for
the next night, let alone the nights to come? How long
would it be now before she was both hungry and penniless?
Would she then have to go into the workhouse&mdash;or what?</p>

<p class="indent">She shuddered in bed, and writhed her fingers as if
suffering physical agony. The cruel horror of the immediate
future seemed to crush her as she lay. For the sake of
her bedfellow she forced herself to remain silent and motionless
for what seemed an interminable period. But giving
way to a sudden invincible panic induced by accumulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
reflections on many possibilities, she started up violently,
and cried in a voice that scarcely sounded her own&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh Heaven! What am I to do?&quot; Then, burying
her face in her hands, she wept unrestrainedly.</p>

<p class="indent">An arm crept round her waist, and she was gently drawn
to the side of her companion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Puir lassie,&quot; said the kindly voice. &quot;You&#39;re o&#39;er-rocht.
Dinna greet, but lie quiet and see what daylight
brings. You&#39;ve a&#39; had a verra tryin&#39; time here, but you&#39;ll
sune be hame aince mair wi&#39; your frien&#39;s, and mayhap a
kind fayther or mither to welcome ye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no, no!&quot; sobbed the girl, &quot;I&#39;ve got no one&mdash;nothing&mdash;no
parents, no home or friends or anything!
Oh, what shall I do? what will become of me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Brodie leaned out of bed and lit a candle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dark is na cheerie,&quot; she declared.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne managed to choke down her grief, and lay back
upon the pillow once more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so sorry to have awakened you. Please go to
sleep again. I&#39;m going to be quite still and quiet now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dinna think o&#39; me,&quot; said the kind-hearted Scots-woman.
&quot;What o&#39; yoursel&#39;, puir bairn? It&#39;s a terrible
thing for a lassie to be a&#39; her lain i&#39; the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Gradually Evarne was prevailed upon to confide the
seriousness of her plight. Miss Brodie grew more and
more pitying and sympathetic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll consult wi&#39; ma sister,&quot; she said, at length. &quot;Jean
has got verra sharp wits frae being in Lunnon. She will
advise ye. Anyway, ma lamb, dinna think that I&#39;ll turn
ye oot a&#39; at aince, though ye had naething in the whole
world but a tongue to say &#39;thank ye&#39; wi&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne kissed her again and again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do meet kind friends, anyway,&quot; she whispered, and
encircled by Miss Brodie&#39;s motherly arms, she at length
fell asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Notwithstanding the disturbances of the night, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
thrifty Scotswoman rose as usual shortly after daybreak,
and by the time Evarne had awoke, dressed and wandered
out into the kitchen, she found that her difficulties and
distresses had already been the subject of careful debate
between Martha and Jean Brodie.</p>

<p class="indent">The latter, a tall, angular young woman, with a somewhat
careworn expression, had justified her sister&#39;s confidence
by almost instantly producing a suggestion anent
the vexed question of earning a livelihood without a week&#39;s
delay. Waiting only until Martha had ladled out a plateful
of porridge and set it before Evarne, she opened the subject
without any preliminary remarks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you at all a good needlewoman, Miss Stornway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only pretty fair,&quot; was the truthful response. &quot;I&#39;ve
done a lot of embroidery, but scarcely any plain sewing.
I made this blouse I&#39;ve got on, though; but not without
help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will do. Now, if my sister didn&#39;t exaggerate,
if you&#39;re really penniless and don&#39;t know which way to
turn&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne cast down her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s right enough,&quot; she said; &quot;go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In that case I can give you a job myself&mdash;that is, if
you&#39;re not too proud to work hard and live humbly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here was indeed a surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only try me,&quot; declared the girl eagerly. &quot;What is
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps Martha told you I was a blousemaker by trade.
I work for a wholesale house in the City. I haven&#39;t got
a big business, but I live by it, and I always have a young
girl under me as an apprentice to do certain parts of the
word. Generally, my assistant lives and boards with me,
I pay her half a crown a week and teach her the business.
As soon as the girl is past the apprentice stage she leaves
me and I get another beginner. My last one left me just
before I came away for my holiday. My girls are generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
only about fourteen or fifteen; but if you care to take the
job for a time, it&#39;s open to you at once, and you&#39;ll get a
better berth presently like the others, if you choose to
continue in the needlework line. There&#39;s my offer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I daursay it seems a bit o&#39; a come-doon i&#39; the world
to you,&quot; interposed Martha, &quot;but when all&#39;s said and done
it&#39;s a respectable, God-fearin&#39; business that no woman
need be ashamed o&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think it over while you eat your breakfast,&quot; advised
Jean.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was distinctly startled at an entirely fresh
career being thus suddenly dangled before her gaze for
inspection. The remuneration offered, two-and-six weekly,
likewise proved amazing. Still, board and lodging were
included in the bond, and, after the terrible pictures her
imagination had painted in the blackness of the past night,
the certain assurance of a sheltering roof, and of bread to
ward off the pangs of hunger, was alone sufficient to form
a bright constellation of stars in her dark sky. Not long
did she stop to consider whether these newly-risen orbs
were of a colour and design pleasing to her fancy. Between
the fifth and sixth spoonfuls of porridge she had signified
her willingness to become a blouse apprentice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then pack up your things as soon as you&#39;ve done eating.
We must catch the half-past eleven train, because of my
excursion ticket.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How&mdash;I hadn&#39;t thought of that&mdash;how am I to get
my fare?&quot; faltered Evarne painfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to lend it to ye, lassie, and sure, you can
pay me back week by week,&quot; declared Martha.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne endeavoured to express her gratitude, but the
only answer she got was&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s naething at a&#39;. Jist keep your breath to cool your
porridge, and make haste too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Speedily finishing her meal, the girl went upstairs to
Mrs. Shiells&#39;s. There, in the kitchen, she found a heated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
quarrel in progress. The &quot;loot&quot; of the disbanded &quot;Caledonia&#39;s
Bard&quot; was the bone of contention. Archie had
carefully packed the limes-box round with stage garments,
enclosed the whole in a drop-scene, tied it all up with gas-tubing,
and then calmly announced that this was his
&quot;little share.&quot; Since there was not much left of any
description, all the other members of the late company,
headed by Douglas, were vigorously protesting.</p>

<p class="indent">Already Archie had been discovered trying to palm off
upon his landlady, in lieu of money, a couple of long
cylinders containing gas&mdash;dangerous, explosive, useless
objects to which no one would willingly even give house-room.
General indignation had been provoked by this
attempt at returning evil for good, and amid the general
uproar it was some time before Evarne could persuade the
excited party to turn their attention to her, and realise
that she had come to bid them farewell.</p>

<p class="indent">The regrets expressed at this parting were perfectly
sincere on both sides. Evarne was being swooped off,
leaving many mysteries unsolved. Where was Madame
Cheape? What would befall the piano that day? Would
Mr. Punter try to reclaim any of his stage belongings?
Moreover, it appeared that that gentleman&#39;s whereabouts
were being eagerly inquired after by a number of the
leading tradesmen of the district, who had been persuaded
to pay cash down for advertisement spaces on the back of
the company&#39;s programmes, misled by the assurance of a
prolonged local tour for &quot;Caledonia&#39;s Bard&quot;&mdash;a fact that
went a long way toward explaining the whole strange
business. Jess and Mont both undertook to write and tell
Evarne all the news, but ere she well knew how it had come
to pass, she found herself in the train being whirled back
to London.</p>

<p class="indent">Another act in the &quot;Drama of Reality&quot; had commenced.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="chXXIV" id="chXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<small>&quot;STITCH, STITCH, STITCH!&quot;</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> house in which Miss Jean Brodie rented a
single room stood in a by-street in the heart of
Camberwell. Despite the knowledge that any
feelings of fastidiousness were now entirely unseemly
and out of place, Evarne could not avoid a certain
dismay at the prospect of actually residing amid such abject
poverty, disorder and squalor. Threading their way between
the swarming dirty children, who shouted and played
and disputed on every side, numerous as rabbits in a warren,
they entered a dark, narrow passage and proceeded to
mount the uncarpeted stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My room is on the top floor,&quot; explained Miss Brodie,
as the first landing was gained. &quot;Rents are very high in
London. There are seven separate lots of people living
in this house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this juncture a voice came from one of the half-open
doors they were passing&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did I do? Why, I says quite perlite-like,
&#39;&#39;Ave a drop o&#39; gin, ol&#39; dear,&#39; but she ups and says to me,
she says&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But what &quot;she&quot; had responded to this invitation was
lost in a peal of laughter from several throats. Miss Brodie
looked supercilious.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s Mrs. Harbert. You won&#39;t need to talk to her
at all. She&#39;s not a very respectable old woman. I&#39;m sure
I wonder the landlord has her in the house; but there, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
doesn&#39;t heed anything so long as he gets his rent
punctually.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne glanced back over her shoulder, and surveyed
this wicked personage! She saw a cleanly, neatly-clad,
comfortable-looking old dame of about sixty, who still
retained traces of unusual good looks. She seemed so
good-natured and happy that Evarne inquired with some
interest into the character of her misdemeanours. She
was more entertained than appalled by the information.
The culprit had been an artist&#39;s model, and the walls of her
room were now absolutely covered with innumerable
paintings and drawings depicting herself in the days of
her youth, &quot;but with not a decent stitch of clothing
among the whole lot, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Brodie&#39;s own apartment, though poor in the extreme,
was certainly respectability itself. As was most
suitable in a room principally designed for needlework, the
floor was uncarpeted, while the bed, with the narrow rug
by its side, the washing-stand and the few clothes-pegs,
were all huddled as much out of the way as possible. The
place of honour in the centre of the room was given to the
substantial table necessary for cutting out, while by the
light of the window stood the sewing-machine. On the
mantelpiece were china ornaments in couples, a pair of
pink vases, and some cheap frames holding family photographs.
On the walls were coloured texts and several
gloomy memorial cards.</p>

<p class="indent">And within these precincts Evarne started upon a life
the conditions of which she had hitherto never dreamed of,
far less realised. Work commencing at eight in the morning,
the stretch of hours until eight at night was unbroken
save by a brief time for meals. Day in and day out&mdash;except
for the blessed Sabbath&mdash;week following week in
slow procession, still found her bent over her needle, stitch,
stitch, stitching as fast as her skill allowed.</p>

<p class="indent">At first, while yet unbroken to the yoke, she many a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
time seriously feared that the day then passing would be
the very last of its kind that she could possibly manage
to endure. The nerve-pangs of irritability and impatience,
of well-nigh uncontrollable rebellion and revolt&mdash;all concealed
with difficulty, but not thereby conquered&mdash;seared
her spirit far more deeply than her left forefinger was
pricked and torn by the needle driven at unaccustomed
speed. Sometimes she would stop working for a minute,
straighten her back, let her hands, together with the
material, drop loosely upon her lap, while she would glance
over at Jean with an expression that said plainly, &quot;Is it
<i>really</i> possible to endure this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Miss Brodie during work-hours was as a part of her
machine&mdash;she never ceased, never looked either to the right
or to the left&mdash;so that after a minute or two nothing remained
for the as yet unresigned apprentice but to
stifle a sigh&mdash;or maybe even a groan&mdash;and again take
up the labour at which her whole nature was vigorously
protesting.</p>

<p class="indent">She wondered if she was naturally idle, or if all other
needlewomen had had to get the mastery over similar
feelings to those that ramped in her breast, when the
monotonous occupation had to be continued for long weary
hours after it had become thoroughly uncongenial? Did
Miss Brodie, for instance, not know what it was to feel
every pulse of her body aching and crying for movement&mdash;change&mdash;liberty?
Was she never conscious that her brain
was frantically protesting against the maddening monotony&mdash;the
unvarying sameness&mdash;the crushing tedium of pushing
that needle in, then pulling that needle out, again and
again and again, as steadily as her pulses beat or her heart
throbbed? Did Jean never have to fight against an almost
uncontrollable impulse to scream, shout, wave her arms,
stamp, swear, play ball with her work, tear down &quot;God
Bless our Home,&quot; and throw it out of the window; do something&mdash;anything&mdash;wild,
mad and unseemly, to relieve the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
tedium and assuage the awful tumult of overwrought
nerves?</p>

<p class="indent">But whatever storms might rage within the recesses of
her own mind, Miss Brodie was ever outwardly calm&mdash;but
then Evarne was to all appearances equally passive, equally
resigned. She never once complained. While pitying herself
as frankly as she sorrowed over a squirrel upon the
wheel; a wood-bird shut in a tiny cage; a young dog
fastened to its kennel in a walled-in yard, strangling itself
frantically against its collar; she suffered all in total silence.</p>

<p class="indent">However, Jean had an outside interest&mdash;a hope that
beyond a doubt served to lighten and brighten the tedium
of these days of toil. She was engaged to be married to a
dashing red-coated soldier, and many of the ends of her
evenings were spent in his inspiriting society.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne&#39;s spare hours were passed in absolute loneliness
and solitude. After supper she would wander out, generally
along the Embankment, but if she had sufficient energy she
would persevere as far as Hyde Park. At all events she
would walk about somewhere until she was wearied, not
returning home until it was time to go to bed. It was a
grey, soul-crushing existence, and she grew depressed and
spiritless beneath its burden.</p>

<p class="indent">She made no effort to change it for anything better.
Miss Brodie was satisfied with her, and was always kind.
One thing was as good as another, and incompetence was a
drug in the labour market. Everyone, too, by whom she
was now surrounded laboured more or less incessantly;
work made up their lives. She was no miserable exception,
no victim, no martyr. Her fate seemed but the common
fate of all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a real pity you can&#39;t get a young man, Miss Stornway,&quot;
said Miss Brodie, worried by her apprentice&#39;s
unconcealable pallor and listlessness. &quot;It certainly does
seem to make everything so much easier.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl smiled and shook her head. Indeed, Camberwell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
was as likely to produce a &quot;young man&quot; for Evarne as was
a desert island. Not that she was overlooked by the male
sex; on the contrary, in common with every girl who is at
once poor and beautiful, practically every man who had
any sort of opportunity commenced, sooner or later, to
make love to her. Quite often strange men turned and
walked by her side in the parks, seeking to engage her in
conversation. But not for one instant was the proud
purity of the beautiful face disturbed. Evarne had loved
Morris Kenyon as truly and purely as ever any young girl
loved. By the shameful arts of the street <i>roué</i> she was
profoundly repelled. So as far as masculine society went,
she lived the life of a young nun.</p>

<p class="indent">She seemed to have nothing left save memories, and
these were all tainted with cruel bitterness. As the weary
weeks lengthened into months the acuteness of all past
emotions&mdash;joys and anguish alike&mdash;became dimmed, and
then faded away. What had been once her life seemed
now only a story she had read long ago. That brilliant
room at &quot;Mon Bijou&quot;; the lovely garden with its winding
mosaic walks; the blueness of the Naples Bay; the snow-capped
mountains of Switzerland; her dainty flat and her
carriage here in London; the vivid sun of Egypt&mdash;none of
this was real, surely? Reality was scanty fare in a top
garret&mdash;incessant stitching&mdash;loneliness&mdash;and nothing else!</p>

<p class="indent">And her love for Morris that she would once have sworn
could have survived all blows, all passing of time, was as
much a thing of the past as were all these other memories.
Morris had slain it himself once and for ever. For some
time she had cherished the corpse, not knowing it to be
lifeless; but gradually the deceptive outward tokens of
vitality faded away. A little longer and the dead thing
fell to dust and was no more. The glamour of Morris&#39;s
presence removed enabled her to see more clearly, not
only the unforgivable nature of the insults with which he
had cast her off, but the great wrong he had done her in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
the first place, and which had directly led down to these
dregs wherein she was now drowning.</p>

<p class="indent">If she had any feeling for him other than indifference,
it was hatred. She felt no gratitude&mdash;not one jot&mdash;for the
money or the care and attention he had once lavished upon
her. It had been nothing to him. And since she was
merely one of many women who in turn occupied those
rooms at &quot;Mon Bijou,&quot; she had no more call to be grateful
for any of the accompanying accessories of the position than
had the horses that passed through his stables.</p>

<p class="indent">She was utterly discontented and unhappy in her present
existence. True, she had safe shelter, sufficient to wear,
and enough to eat to keep life within her&mdash;but, merciful
Heaven, what a price she paid for that doubtful boon!
Morning after morning she regained consciousness with
reluctance, shrinking from the joyless, unbroken monotony
of the day that stretched its weary length before her&mdash;anxious
only to get it done and added to those that were
already lived through. She never read now, for her eyes
ached painfully long ere work was ended.</p>

<p class="indent">Tortured at first by her unemployed powers of heart and
brain and soul fighting for expression, all too soon she
became bitterly conscious that they were yielding to disuse&mdash;becoming
crushed and deadened. It did seem hard to
have to put all her strength, all her active energies of mind
and body&mdash;all herself&mdash;into the making of cheap blouses.
She felt she was being wasted, but that it was inevitable.
What was being killed in her would not make money.</p>

<p class="indent">It was some time before she could realise that she had
found her true level in life&#39;s struggle, and that needlework
was her doom. At first she was always waiting for
something to &quot;turn up,&quot; for the unexpected to happen.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;And is this all of life?&#39; she said;</span><br />
<span class="i0">&#39;This daily toil for daily bread?&#39;&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">And as the conviction grew that this cruel question must
be answered in the affirmative&mdash;that all heretofore had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
been but prelude, unstable and fleeting, that this was
life now upon her in grim serious earnest&mdash;her heart grew
bitter, and her once sweet, bright expression gave way to
a settled look of sad discontent.</p>

<p class="indent">But through all this her resolution to lead evermore a
&quot;good&quot; life never faltered. She would not even contemplate
endeavouring to bring sparks of brightness into
her cheerless existence by setting aflame any man&#39;s affection,
legally or otherwise. Come what might, she had done
with that sort of thing once and for all.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Burling she visited once or twice, but her correspondence
with both Margaret and Jess slackened and ceased.
Separated and so unhappy, she found it difficult to know
what to say to them, while they both could produce but
heavy and laboured epistles. She liked Jean Brodie fairly
well, but they were very opposed in character, and for the
greater portion of each day the silence of the workroom
was unbroken save for the clipping of the scissors or the
whirring of the machine.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXV" id="chXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<small>HARD LUCK</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">But</span> although Evarne would not have deemed it
possible, worse still remained for her upon the
knees of the gods.</p>

<p class="indent">Jean Brodie returned home one Sunday in a
state of unconcealed excitement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Stornway, I&#39;m going to be married. The banns
are to be called for the first time next Sabbath. My young
man&#39;s regiment is going out to India in six weeks, and he&#39;s
just got leave to marry &#39;on the strength,&#39; so he can take
me with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After suitable congratulations, and so on, the conversation
veered round to Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you follow my advice, Miss Stornway, you&#39;ll carry
on my business. You&#39;ve done a lot of good work for me,
my dear, so in memory of that I&#39;ll give you all&mdash;well,
nearly all&mdash;the furniture of the room. I must take a few
things with me, and I can&#39;t let you have my sewing-machine,
but you can procure a nice one on the hire system. Then
get a young girl as an apprentice. I&#39;ll introduce you to
the City firm I work for, and you&#39;ll be comfortably settled.
What do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne naturally thanked her, whereupon Miss Brodie
set forth the expenditure of the establishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The work brings in above seventeen shillings weekly.
Two shillings is enough to pay the apprentice, a young girl,
you know. There&#39;s three-and-six for rent, add to which
you must allow three-and-six for your machine, that&#39;s nine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
shillings. That leaves you with eight shillings for food
for the two of you, candles, a bit of firing, the goose club,
the church collection, twopence for a hot bath&mdash;everything
else, in fact. It seems very little somehow! I know, it&#39;s
the hiring of the machine takes your money. I&#39;ve managed
to save some every week, and so will you in
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus the matter was settled. Evarne was present at
Jean&#39;s marriage, and a few days later waved her farewell
from the station as the good Scotswoman departed with
the other soldiers&#39; wives. Then the girl walked back to her
now empty room with a fresh sense of depression. After
all, Jean had been a friend in need, and had remained her
only intimate acquaintance in London.</p>

<p class="indent">As she wended her way upstairs a sudden stumble was
heard on the upper flight, and immediately after half a
dozen rosy apples came bounding down. At the same time
the disreputable Mrs. Harbert&#39;s voice was heard calling
shrilly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ere, Smithkins! Come to the rescue! Buck up!
Everything&#39;s a-goin&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus abjured, Mrs. Smithkins hurried out from her room
and lent her aid. Evarne, having gathered up the apples,
joining the group.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s something of yours,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good retriever! &#39;Ave one,&quot; was the response.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhat objecting to be thus described, the girl declined
the gift, and was continuing her way upstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wait a bit. I must give yer somethin&#39; for yer trouble,
me dear. I&#39;ll learn yer some cookin&#39;. Best and quickest
way to make a sausage roll. D&#39;you know it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take a sausage to the top of the stairs and chuck it
down&mdash;like them apples rolled. See? Ha, ha! Shakespeare!
No, not &#39;im this time. That was the clown at the
pantomime last year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
Evarne certainly thought the old dame was slightly
incoherent, and smiling indulgently took another step
upstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Done it!&quot; declared Mrs. Harbert triumphantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What &#39;ave yer done now?&quot; inquired Mrs. Smithkins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Made &#39;er laugh! Said I would. I fair &#39;ate to see a
glum look on a pretty face. You&#39;ve lost yer friend, Miss
Stornway. Now, won&#39;t yer come in an&#39; &#39;ave a cosy cup o&#39;
tea along o&#39; me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An&#39; see &#39;er wunnerful pictures,&quot; sniggered Mrs. Smithkins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jist be off with yer. To the pure all things is white as
wool. Shakespeare! Miss Stornway&#39;s a real laidy. She
knows Shakespeare, I bet. You ask &#39;er.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All this certainly succeeded in distracting Evarne&#39;s
mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said. &quot;I shall very much like to
come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The visit turned out very successful, though it was perforce
but brief, as the girl had to be back at her labours
again. Only by uninterrupted industry could the requisite
number of blouses be finished, and Evarne, with only a few
weeks&#39; practice at machining, was far less rapid than had
been Miss Brodie with her ten years&#39; experience. Milly,
the new fourteen-year-old apprentice, was clumsy and somewhat
idle, so that there was now less time than ever in
Evarne&#39;s life for protracted afternoon calls.</p>

<p class="indent">Day after day she worked with a will, and though at
first her uttermost endeavours only brought in about
fourteen-and-sixpence each week, she rapidly grew more
skilful. Milly, too, became quicker and more useful, and
things were thus promising to become decidedly easier
when an unforeseen accident occurred. It was just one of
those foolish little mishaps that nobody can always succeed
in guarding against. This one was very unromantic in its
origin. Evarne was seated on the side of one of the public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
baths, polishing and paring and generally attending to her
pretty pink feet and nails, when somehow she lost her
balance and fell. In saving herself from splashing half-dressed
into the water, she contrived to drive the point of
the scissors into her finger, right down to the bone.</p>

<p class="indent">It only left a little wound, which Mrs. Harbert tied up
with a piece of rag, and although it was the right hand, the
girl continued her work next day as if nothing had happened.
But in the night the pain grew so bad that it awoke
her and prevented her sleeping again, while the daylight
showed the wounded finger to be ominously blue and
swollen. This spread with terrible rapidity and ere long
her hand was totally useless. Full of alarm she hurried
off to the hospital, and had her suspicions of blood-poisoning
confirmed. The poor hand was carefully bandaged up
and put into a sling, and, almost overwhelmed by this new
anxiety, the girl returned home to see what could be done
about her work.</p>

<p class="indent">Everything now devolved upon Milly. Evarne contrived
to cut out the blouses with her left hand, and to do a
little tacking, but all else had to be left to the apprentice.
Evarne could but encourage and supervise, and wearying
work that proved. Even in these new circumstances
Milly was still slow and idle, and if she was pressed to work
faster, she ceased sewing altogether and whimpered.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus a miserable three shillings was all that could be
earned in the first week, and the next six days showed an
increase of but ninepence. Evarne had about half a
sovereign laid by, and out of this she paid Milly&#39;s wages
and the hire of the all-precious machine. But in the
second week, when the landlord made his usual Monday
rent-collecting visit, she was forced to beg his indulgence,
showing her blue and bandaged hand as an excuse and
explanation. At first he told her roughly enough that he
did not run his houses as a philanthropic undertaking, and
that if his tenants could not pay they just had to go. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
finally he grew more sympathetic, and at last quite kind.
He actually promised to take no steps whatsoever for a
month, and if she stayed on after that she could make it up
at the rate of a shilling a week.</p>

<p class="indent">She recovered the partial use of her hand in less than the
stipulated time, and resumed her place at the machine.
But she had now got thoroughly backward with money
matters. Only by pawning everything in the room that
was not absolutely essential could she pay both rent and
machine hire, and the eight to ten shillings that was all her
still crippled hand was able to earn seemed to be swallowed
up immediately she received it. Only about eighteen-pence
at the outside could she manage to retain to buy food
for herself and her apprentice.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, Miss Milly was not particular, and had made few
complaints at being reduced to a diet of potatoes and bread
and scrape; tea made of leaves used a second time; rice
boiled in water and sweetened by a little condensed milk,
and so on. When, however, the quantity came to be also
unpleasantly restricted her hearty appetite, unappeased,
rendered her decidedly fractious.</p>

<p class="indent">Her honorarium had been reduced by Miss Stornway to
a shilling weekly, on the promise that it should be more
than made up later, but now she was apparently expected
to spend even this miserable half-pay on sustaining life.
True, Miss Stornway always took far the smaller portion
of every meagre meal, but unfortunately even that fact
did not fill the cavity in Milly&#39;s stomach. So the day came
when that damsel, being entrusted with a penny and sent
out to purchase an ounce of tea, returned no more. In
the evening came a note:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dere Miss</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;i&#39;ve gorn ome to my mother Because i wants
more to eat. it aint your forlt miss nor it aint mine and
mother Says its rite if you works ard you ort to ave Enuf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
to eat two shillings you Ows me dont trubble about miss
Eat it.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Yours respeckful,</p>

<p class="author">&quot;<span class="smcap">Milly</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Whether a sting or a kindness lay in the closing sentence,
Evarne knew not, but all the statements in the letter
were as clearly undeniable as was the fact that Milly had
deserted her. She felt both ashamed and strangely forsaken,
and crushing the scrap of paper in her hand, rested
her pale cheek on the bare boards of the table, while tears
of feebleness and helplessness rolled from her weary eyes
and slowly soaked their way into the wood.</p>

<p class="indent">Hampered as she was by her still awkwardly swollen
and painful hand, with those terrible debts clinging like
leeches, and with the imperative need there had been for
every penny that she and her assistant had earned by their
united efforts, she could not conceive how she was possibly
to manage without any help whatsoever. Milly might
have stood by her a little longer, she thought sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no chance of economising on anything save
food, and to such lengths was she now forced to carry this
disastrous self-denial, that the uninitiated might have supposed
she was trying to solve the problem of how to live
without eating. Naturally dainty, she had, in Jean&#39;s
day, often left untouched much of the indifferent food
provided. Now she consumed far rougher and more unpalatable
meals to the last crumb with avidity, and once or
twice even ignobly consumed what should have been her
supper at the same time as her dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">She bravely persevered with her work, cutting-out and
machining and stitching from early morning until darkness
descended. Even then she continued her weary
labours with the work held close up to the light of a guttering
candle, until practical inability to see longer forced her
to cease, to throw herself upon her bed and sleep.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
But the night time brought very imperfect rest. Constantly
she was awakened by the vividness of dreams of
banquets; well-stored provision shops; food lying in the
very gutter while people held her back from reaching it;
boards lavishly spread, whence every dish faded immediately
she thrust forth her hand to grasp its contents.</p>

<p class="indent">Scarcely ever did she leave the four bare walls of her
room, save for necessary business. Not only had she
neither time nor strength, but now the soles of her shoes
were worn into great holes and her stockings were no longer
mendable, so that her bare feet trod the pavement, and
became bruised and blistered.</p>

<p class="indent">And every effort, additional to the day&#39;s routine, was to
be avoided. Scarcely could she drag herself up of a morning,
repeatedly would she find that the treadle of the
machine was being worked slower and yet more slowly, as
a dull stupor and inertness crept like a fog over her mind.
Once she wasted a whole afternoon by fainting, and came
to herself to find that nightfall had set in while she was
lying unconscious upon the floor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if I&#39;m going to die? Perhaps I ought to
warn somebody or&mdash;or do something. I wonder?&quot; She
asked herself this question one late afternoon as she finished
tying up the parcel of completed blouses, and found that
she could not walk across the room with them without
staggering and reeling.</p>

<p class="indent">She recalled a ghastly account she had read in the paper,
of a man who had died in a locked-up flat, and was never
discovered until his corpse decomposed and soaked through
the floor to the ceiling below.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Harbert is just underneath me. I wonder if she
would move if that happened?&quot; Evarne grimly and
wretchedly pondered as she commenced to descend the
stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Ere she was half-way down she suddenly stood still.
What was happening? Why was there that vast yawning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
pit below? It wasn&#39;t real&mdash;no, she knew it&mdash;but all the
same it made her dizzy. She grew blind, and her brain
seemed to heave madly. Dropping her parcel, she pressed
both hands over her eyes. Was she swaying to and fro, or
were the stairs rocking beneath her feet? She made a wild
clutch at the banisters, but her fingers closed only upon the
air. She was falling&mdash;falling&mdash;yet could not save herself,
and a scream of terror rang through the house ere unconsciousness
closed in upon her, and she fell with a dull
thud down to the landing below.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXVI" id="chXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<small>EVARNE&#39;S VOCATION</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Evarne next opened her eyes she was lying
cosily enough in bed. What a strange troubled
sleep she had had, so full of confused dreams!
Instantly came a fear of oversleeping, and she
made an effort to rise. But the attempt was vain; even
her half-opened lids were insupportably heavy. Languidly
she let them droop, and then knew nothing more until a
spoon was placed to her lips, and she felt some warm liquid
meandering down her throat. At this the heavy lids were
lifted widely in astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bravo! My pretty dolly is made to open its eyes!&quot;
cried a cheery voice, and there by her side was old Mrs.
Harbert, gazing at her smilingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne looked slowly around. This was not her own
room&mdash;no&mdash;all those artist&#39;s studies&mdash;where was it? Then
she remembered. She must surely be in Mrs. Harbert&#39;s
own domain.</p>

<p class="indent">Her lips shaped the words, &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, ha! My dolly talks,&quot; was the only answer she
received.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl tried to arouse herself further, but enthralled
by a heavy lethargy, she abandoned the attempt, and
gradually fell asleep once more.</p>

<p class="indent">When next she awoke the sharp sound of a falling cup
had aroused her more thoroughly. She lifted her head
slightly from the pillow. There stood Mrs. Smithkins,
looking at her with much concern.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
&quot;Lor&#39; now, I do &#39;ope I &#39;aven&#39;t done no &#39;arm by wakin&#39;
yer up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Am I ill?&quot; whispered Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve bin at death&#39;s door,&quot; impressively replied Mrs.
Smithkins, with obvious satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember. I was going downstairs. Did I fall?
Tell me everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The doctor says yer ain&#39;t to speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You talk; I&#39;ll listen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nothing loath, Mrs. Smithkins set to and related the
story. It appeared that everybody in the house had run
from their rooms at the sound of Evarne&#39;s terrible tumble,
and, lifting up her unconscious form, had laid her upon
Mrs. Harbert&#39;s bed&mdash;the nearest at hand. Her forehead,
which was cut and bleeding, had been promptly tied up.
But neither lavish sprinkling of water, draughts of undiluted
gin, the burning of feathers nor the tickling of her
palms, had sufficed to bring her to her senses, so the parish
doctor had been called in. He had said a lot of things
none of the hearers had been able to properly understand,
but finally had said clearly enough that it would be weeks
ere she was well again.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Harbert had undertaken to nurse her, and, according
to Mrs. Smithkins, had fulfilled this promise like an
angel of light. Sometimes she had been forced to be absent
for the best part of the day about her work, but she had
always prepared the invalid&#39;s diet beforehand, and Mrs.
Smithkins had administered it. The doctor had been ever
so many times! Once he even came twice in one day!
As to Evarne&#39;s room upstairs, it was let to somebody else.
A man from the firm had come and taken away the sewing
machine, her bed was here&mdash;Mrs. Harbert now slept on it&mdash;her
chair and table and other belongings were on the
landing upstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">Left alone, Evarne lay awake for hours pondering.
She half regretted that she had not died; that would so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
have simplified matters. Now she had the future to
worry about once more; and she felt positively overwhelmed
by the knowledge of her poor old neighbour&#39;s
extraordinary charity. When evening fell, and Mrs.
Harbert entered very softly on tiptoe, Evarne greeted her,
feeling quite embarrassed by the extent of this debt of
gratitude.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, my dolly is quite well agin, the Lord be praised,&quot;
declared the old woman, beaming all over her face.</p>

<p class="indent">Placing on a chair the packed market-basket she carried,
she proceeded to lay its contents one by one on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve got something for yer,&quot; she declared, triumphantly
holding up a couple of volumes. &quot;I bought &#39;em
from an old bookstall. &#39;Rose Leaves or Strawberry
Leaves? A Romance of Society.&#39; That sounds real
exciting, and will amuse &#39;er, thinks I, and then &#39;Gull&mdash;Gully
somebody&#39;s Travels.&#39; That will be instructive, and
will educate &#39;er mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Harbert, you are far, far too good to me. I shall
never be able to thank you properly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yer can&#39;t do nothin&#39; properly till yer gits well, and
the doctor&mdash;nice old chap &#39;e is too&mdash;says yer ain&#39;t to
talk.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doctors always say that. Why are you so kind to
me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Cause I likes it. My gosh, &#39;ere am I, a lonely old
woman, and when &#39;Eaven drops a nice-spoken pretty gal,
bang splosh at my very front door, d&#39;you think I was goin&#39;
to just git out my broom and sweep &#39;er away? That ain&#39;t
Philadelphia &#39;Arbert.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll get well quickly now, not to cause you any more
trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;&#39;E goes quickest who takes time by the nose,&#39; as
Shakespeare says.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you come to study Shakespeare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
&quot;It was this way. Yer know, my dear, I&#39;m a hartist&#39;s
model. All these pictures on the wall are me. I showed
&#39;em to yer once before, didn&#39;t I? My gosh, when I was a
gal&mdash;a young woman&mdash;I was real lovely. But yer can see
that for yourself, though these &#39;ere pictures is only students&#39;
work, and don&#39;t do me real credit. Still, jist notice my
shapely legs in this one. Nice bust too, eh! See my back
&#39;ere&mdash;there&#39;s a fine straight back for yer. Every great
hartist painted me in them days. I was a regular queen
among &#39;em&mdash;&#39;eaps more work offered me than I could
manage. There was one gentleman&mdash;oh, a real nice gentleman
&#39;e was too, pore dear, &#39;e&#39;s dead now&mdash;and &#39;e used
to &#39;ave Shakespeare read out to &#39;im all the time &#39;e worked.
I often posed for &#39;im, and as I&#39;ve got a good memory I
picked it up, and bits of it is always comin&#39; into my mind.
My gosh, Miss Stornway, I tell yer it do make the other old
gals in this &#39;ouse that jealous! I&#39;m always sittin&#39; on &#39;em
with my quotes, and they can&#39;t do nothin&#39; but keep their
hignorant old tongues still and look silly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus she rattled on, meantime proceeding to prepare the
evening meal for herself and her charge.</p>

<p class="indent">Days passed, and having once started upon her convalescence,
Evarne gained strength rapidly. At the end
of a week she was able to leave her bed. The colour and
contour gradually returned to her pale, thin cheeks, the
brightness to her eye, all her marvellous beauty blossomed
forth afresh. At the end of a fortnight she was strong
enough to take her first outing in the form of a short ride
on the top of a &#39;bus.</p>

<p class="indent">On returning from this expedition she lay down while
Mrs. Harbert made tea, and over the genial beverage the
old woman for the first time consented to discuss future
plans. Evarne had two or three various suggestions to
bring forward, but Mrs. Harbert would not even listen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s only one sensible thing for yer to do, Evarne,
my gal, and that&#39;s to follow in my footsteps. Needlework
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
and sich-like may be all right for some, but for you&mdash;why,
it&#39;s jist a wicked waste of Gawd&#39;s gifts. Now, I&#39;ll tell yer,
when yer was ill and me and Smithkins was givin&#39; my dolly
a bath, I says to &#39;er, I says, &#39;My gosh, what a lovely
gal!&#39; and Smithkins she says&mdash;&mdash;Now, whatever are
yer blushin&#39; for, my dear? You are a real lovely gal, and
I speaks as one who knows what&#39;s what. I never seemed
to notice it when yer was bundled up in clothes; that&#39;s the
way with the best of us, we never appears to advantage in
togs. It&#39;s the skinny women with waists the size of their
ankles, what no hartist would so much as look at; or them
females as is bundles of fat what wouldn&#39;t look human if
they wasn&#39;t packed up tidy into corsets&mdash;they&#39;re the sort
what looks best in their clothes. Beautiful women like
you and me looks better and better as we undresses more
and more. You&#39;ll make a fortune as a model, and you&#39;ll
be a bigger fool than I take yer for if yer chucks away
that fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne remained silent, pondering over this suggestion.
Instant objections sprang to her mind, but at the same
time came the conviction that here indeed was a means
of earning a livelihood for which she was undeniably well
qualified. Her own experience as an artist had taught
her both the value and the rarity of a figure, beautiful from
an artistic point of view. At the same time....</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Harbert broke in upon her reflections.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps yer was thinkin&#39; it ain&#39;t proper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the girl shook her head immediately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; she declared. &quot;I studied Art myself, and painted
from the nude, when I was better off, so I should have got
rid of any ideas of that sort, even if I had ever had them;
but I never had. I was just thinking that it really was a
brilliant notion of yours, but that I didn&#39;t quite like it
somehow. Still, I believe that if you hadn&#39;t spoken just
then, I should have gone on to reflect that beggars can&#39;t
be choosers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
&quot;Ah, Shakespeare! But why don&#39;t yer like it, if yer
ain&#39;t shocked? It&#39;s the nicest profession in the world.
Takes yer among sich &#39;igh-class people&mdash;real ladies and
gentlemen&mdash;and into sich nice warm rooms. And what&#39;s
more, yer can go on till yer are as old as old&mdash;as a costume
model anyway. Of course, while you&#39;re young, the sun
shines, and yer bucks up and makes yer &#39;ay accordin&#39;.
Yer can earn pounds a week sometimes, quite easy. Look
at me&mdash;I&#39;m a middle-aged one now, yet I makes a pretty
fair livin&#39; by it, and don&#39;t overwork myself neither.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How would I start to get work? Is it difficult to get
up a connection?&quot; inquired the girl dubiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not for the likes of you. You&#39;d only &#39;ave to show
yerself. But yer still looks ill, and you&#39;re ever so weak.
You&#39;ve got to be strong to &#39;stand,&#39; I can tell yer. &#39;Tain&#39;t
no use beginnin&#39; yet. I wish we could git yer away to the
seaside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll get well quickly in London now&mdash;I will really. I&#39;ll
go out into the parks every day for fresh air, and be as
strong as ever I was in no time. You shall see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She duly followed this prescription, with the result
prophesied. It had been inexpressibly painful to feel that
she was being maintained by this hard-working old woman,
upon whom she had not the slightest claim, and at the
same time to doubt her power of ever making due recompense.
Now, with a mind at ease once more as to the future,
the open air, the rest, and the ample though simple diet
were free to fulfil their good work. In less than a fortnight
Mrs. Harbert was able to declare her <i>protégée</i> to be blooming
as a rose, and a picture unpainted.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly she set about finding an engagement for
the girl, and one morning, a week or two later, she watched
Evarne set off for an advanced and important Art school,
armed with good courage, a packet of sandwiches and some
sage advice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody guesses it&#39;s yer first sittin&#39;, me dear, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
nobody won&#39;t take no notice of yer if yer don&#39;t tell &#39;em.
Walk out of the dressin&#39;-room as bold as brass, and grumble
under yer breath at the pose the master chooses, no matter
what it is. If you won&#39;t come when &#39;e calls, or run back
agin, or act the fool in any way what ain&#39;t usual with
models, they&#39;ll all remember you&#39;re a human bein&#39;, and
stare at yer, anxious to know what&#39;s the matter. Then,
likely enough, you would feel rather put out of countenance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going to be silly at all,&quot; Evarne had declared
with conviction; and sure enough, when she returned in
the evening she was able to state that the entire day had
gone off satisfactorily.</p>

<p class="indent">She had not expected to be much troubled by inopportune
bashfulness, and when she found herself again in a
studio, beheld the easels and drawing-boards, canvases
and palettes, smelt the characteristic odours and heard the
familiar artistic jargon of the students, she had felt herself
to be an acolyte in a temple wherein was worshipped the
perpetuation of the beautiful. The influence of modern
thought and custom had fallen from her with her garments,
and she had adored her own fairness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry if it sounds immodest,&quot; she confessed,
&quot;but indeed I only felt happy to be in the atmosphere of
Art once more. I knew that those young men, who all
seemed so much in earnest, would learn much from painting
me&mdash;for it was a very charming pose&mdash;and somehow I felt
interested in everyone, and as if I wanted them all to get
on, and was glad to be able to help them to progress a
little. Oh, Mrs. Harbert! Somehow I feel that if only I
came across a real artist&mdash;a grand man, you know, but
young, who hadn&#39;t found himself yet, so to speak&mdash;I could
inspire him to do such wonderful work, to paint pictures
he had never dreamed of before. I don&#39;t fancy I should
ever have been much of an artist myself, even if I&#39;d been
able to keep on&mdash;perhaps I should though! Anyhow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
I know I have got something in my heart or mind,
or something vague of that sort, that I could give out
to another if he could receive it, and had some of the
impulse I&#39;m talking about of his own, and then he would be
able to do what otherwise he would never be able to do....
I am getting dreadfully incoherent, but I know
what I mean myself. Did you ever feel anything like what
I&#39;ve been describing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The old woman would not commit herself to a direct
answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a blessing yer looks at it in that light,&quot; she commented.</p>

<p class="indent">But nothing could possibly have surpassed Mrs. Harbert&#39;s
real opinion of the importance of the part played by the
model in the production of any picture of worth, so she was
fully sympathetic, no matter to what heights the girl might
soar on the topic.</p>

<p class="indent">And now Evarne found that she had indeed alighted upon
a profession in which she had little to fear for competition,
neither did she require much more aid from Mrs. Harbert.
Before her fortnight at the Art school was completed, she
had already obtained another engagement.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s the elder sister of one of the young men,&quot; she
explained gleefully. &quot;The youth seems to have waxed
somewhat enthusiastic about me; so much so that his
sister, who is an artist, came down to the school to see the
wonder with her own eyes. She wants me to start sitting
for her next Monday. Am I not fortunate? She seemed
such a nice woman, and her brother says she paints beautifully.
I am so pleased about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And this success was only the beginning. Ere long
Evarne found herself the proud recipient of more offers
than she could possibly accept. Allowing herself to be
guided by the experienced Mrs. Harbert, she discriminated
among them, and also gradually raised her terms. Nevertheless,
work continued to flow in unceasingly; very rarely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
was there even half a week day that she could regard as
a holiday.</p>

<p class="indent">As time passed she became quite well known in the
artistic world, and sometimes even fulfilled particularly
well-paid engagements out of London. Not only was the
girl absolutely delightful to the eye, both in face and form,
but many an artist found her presence in his studio to be
strangely valuable. It was her sympathy with any aspiring
worker&mdash;the keen interest she took in the picture
on hand&mdash;quite as much as her quick understanding, her
almost intuitive divination of its creator&#39;s ideas, unexpressed
thoughts and half-conceived fancies, that gave her
a unique power that the painters themselves were quick
to feel. Her own artistic instincts and her studio training
had given her the gift of falling easily and instinctively
into poses full of grace and expression. Quite frequently
too, studying the half-completed work, ideas would come
to her which, with a gentle diffidence, she would suggest&mdash;usually
to find her thought taken advantage of to the vast
benefit of the picture. Unquestionably Evarne had found
her vocation at last.</p>

<p class="indent">Had she been plunged into the career of a model immediately
upon leaving her petted, luxurious life with Morris
Kenyon, she would probably have considered it as a truly
miserable lot&mdash;and herself as a victim of cruel fate. But
her descent in the social scale had been so gradual, and had
led to such an abyss of abject poverty and humiliation
before she had almost groped her way into the next world
by the gateway of starvation, that this new existence
shone brightly by comparison.</p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally she would smile just a little bitterly on
comparing her early dreams of artistic fame with the reality
of settling down contentedly enough to serving as a mere
accessory in the production of pictures. But she had
never been genuinely ambitious, and the pang was not
severe. Besides, the counsels of Socrates could step in at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
such moments, and bring contentment and resignation.
Poverty she feared and hated, but now that came not near
her. True, sweet luxury was also but a memory of the
past, but she was well able to live in perfect comfort.</p>

<p class="indent">The five years that followed her adoption of this new
profession were successful, prosperous, and, in their way,
happy. Her beauty was not of the type that wanes with
girlhood&mdash;each year brought added graces. Her path
through life was encompassed with affection, good-will,
regard. She made a circle of acquaintances for herself&mdash;bohemian,
but bright, kindly and amusing. In every
studio she entered she was admired instantly and respected
ere long. Both men and women artists were considerate
and friendly towards the stately young model, and this was
all that she desired.</p>

<p class="indent">In those five years more than a few men fell captive
beneath her subtle charm, but never a one could gain her
love, and she ruthlessly made it clear that she regarded
unwanted masculine devotion as the most useless and undesirable
thing on earth. Neither did the wealth and good
position of at least one of her honourable suitors affect her.
Evarne was true to her heart, as she had ever been.</p>

<p class="indent">She was unfailing in friendship and gratitude towards
the old woman to whom she owed so much of her present
calm contentment. Very speedily she had discharged her
monetary debts to Philia&mdash;for so she affectionately abbreviated
Mrs. Philadelphia Harbert&#39;s somewhat ponderous
first name&mdash;but that was not all.</p>

<p class="indent">Her first upward step had been to move into a couple
of rooms in a neighbouring house, furnishing them gradually
in a manner pleasing to her taste. After a year or so she
grew ambitious, and inviting Philia to join forces with her,
migrated to Chelsea. There she took a little house in a
poor yet eminently respectable street. Her new domain
had a tiny garden in front, a yet tinier grass plot behind, and
contained four rooms and a kitchen. True, there was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
room for the proverbial swinging of a cat, but Evarne was
touchingly proud of her little home, and spent money upon
its furnishing with truly extravagant abandon.</p>

<p class="indent">Old Philia&#39;s engagements as a model had for years past
been somewhat difficult to obtain, and as Evarne waxed
wealthier, so Philia had fallen into low water. It was
accordingly arranged between them, on their first deciding
to live together, that when the elder woman was actually
earning money she should pay somewhat towards the expenses
of their joint establishment. At other times it was
to be regarded as fully equivalent if she undertook to prepare
breakfast and supper for Evarne, the principal breadwinner
and rent-payer; to superintend the labour of the
occasional charwoman, and generally to see to the little
home being kept neat and clean and cosy.</p>

<p class="indent">As time passed, Philia almost entirely abandoned posing,
and devoted herself to domestic labours. Evarne delighted
in being looked after, tended and made much of, so she was
well content with this state of affairs. As to Philia, she
found herself absolutely happy in her old age, and was
given to quoting imaginary passages from Shakespeare
largely, to show that her first disinterested kindness towards
her poor young upstairs neighbour had been as bread
cast on the waters, which was now returning itself in the
form of cake.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXVII" id="chXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<small>IN ARTIST-LAND</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">One</span> winter morning the monotony of the studio
in which Evarne was posing was broken by the
unannounced entrance of a young man.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Towning, the owner of the domain, threw
down his palette, and greeted the newcomer heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, it&#39;s Hardy! Haven&#39;t seen you for ages, old
chap.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Up to my eyes in work. And I see you&#39;re hard at it
too. Don&#39;t let me interrupt business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus adjured, Towning recommenced his interrupted
occupation, while his visitor stood by and scrutinised his
labours.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re making a fine thing of that,&quot; was the verdict.
&quot;The colour scheme is delightful&mdash;absolutely. That touch
of blue just there&mdash;splendid! I say, what a splendid model
you&#39;ve got.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Towning lowered his voice a trifle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and that touch of blue was her suggestion, if you
please. What do you think of that? Have you not seen
her before&mdash;Evarne Stornway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, is that who it is? Of course I&#39;ve heard of her.
Only last week some chap was in to see Geoff, and he
fairly raved over her. By Jove, he wasn&#39;t far wrong
either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s quite uncommon, isn&#39;t she? It&#39;s not often one
finds a glorious shape like that, more&#39;s the pity. By the
way, what&#39;s Geoff Danvers working at now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;He&#39;s off to Venice at the end of March. He&#39;s going
to paint abroad till next winter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lucky dog. It&#39;s all right to have plenty of money,
isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there are not many who use it as Geoff does.
Heaven knows what I should do without him, and now he
is not going alone to Venice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s taking two young chaps, Melcarp and Thorpe,
with him. It will be the time of their lives. They haven&#39;t
got a spare penny piece between them, and could as easily
have taken themselves to study in the moon as in Italy.
Geoff is paying all their expenses, and making out that it&#39;s
a favour on their part that they&#39;re coming. Vows he would
die of dulness without company. Melcarp and Thorpe
are half off their heads with excitement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lucky beggars. What will you do when he&#39;s gone?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, plod along in the studio as usual. I have got a
fine idea for a picture, and I am hunting for a model. The
subject is a couple of lines of Keates&#39;s &#39;Belle Dame sans
Merci,&#39; and I want a girl with reddish-golden hair and a
palish face; gleaming eyes, deep set; and cruel red lips&mdash;all
curves. Not a fine bouncing wench at all, but one of
those weird, fascinating, fragile sort of women&mdash;you know
what I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you surely don&#39;t expect to find exactly what you
want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Scarcely. But if I could only get the right coloured
hair with the pale face it would be something. To tell the
truth, Towning,&quot; the young artist avowed, with a moment&#39;s
outburst of confidence,&quot; I haven&#39;t got as much imagination
as an artist really wants. I don&#39;t get a clear vision of
things in my mind; I just get a shadowy sort of notion.
But unless I can have some degree of reality before me,
very similar to my vague fancy&mdash;well, I am nowhere. My
idea just dies away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
&quot;Paint portraits. There&#39;s more money in that than in
anything else, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that reminds me of a bit of real luck. When Lord
Winborough returns to England in the autumn, he has
promised to let me do a bust of him to exhibit. Splendid
chance, isn&#39;t it? But I am awfully set on doing that
&#39;Belle Dame&#39; picture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps Miss Stornway knows of a girl with red-gold
hair and all the rest of it. By the way, it&#39;s time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He ceased working, and slightly nodded to Evarne.
She stood up, stretched her arms over her head, gave a
couple of tiny kicks to take the stiffness from one of her
knees, then slipped behind the screen that formed a
temporary dressing-room. She reappeared, clad in a
loose crimson wrapper, and sat down by the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">The young men joined her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You heard what we were talking about, of course, Miss
Stornway?&quot; questioned Towning. &quot;Is there a &#39;Belle
Dame&#39; among your friends?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Evarne was unable to render assistance. She knew
of two models with red-gold hair, but the accompanying
round, rosy faces and <i>retroussé</i> noses of both were in no way
mystic and interesting. All she could do was to promise
to remember the requirement, and to send any likely
damsel along for inspection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you. But you&#39;re about the fiftieth person who&#39;s
on the lookout,&quot; returned Jack Hardy ruefully.</p>

<p class="indent">When he finally took his departure, he walked slowly
back to Kensington, a cloud of discontent upon his brow.
His mind was full of his picture, the great work he was
longing to commence, yet&mdash;morbidly conscious of his own
limitations&mdash;he was resolutely determined not to start
without having found a suitable model for the central
figure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>must</i> get on! I <i>must</i> make headway! All my youth
is passing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
He almost snarled these words aloud. Earnest, enthusiastic,
patiently hard-working, Jack Hardy was devoid
of one spark of divine inspiration, and knew it but too well
for his peace of mind. He saw his own handiwork without
gloss or glamour; viewed it as it was in stern reality, good
in composition, in technique, but commonplace&mdash;oh!
Ph&oelig;bus Apollo and all ye Muses&mdash;how sadly commonplace!
Not a man or woman, trained and practised as he
was, but could have done equally well. In the ripest fruit
of his hand and brain there was absolutely nothing individual;
scarce a trace of originality; no magnetism, no
grip. Never had Jack Hardy completed a work, and looking
upon it said within himself: &quot;None but I could have
produced just this result. Only the combination of heart
and brain and soul and knowledge that makes Me could
have evolved this picture. I myself am in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As a student, a great future had been prophesied for him,
and in those days he had believed in himself. But time
had glided by, his thirtieth year was past, his powers had
matured without enlarging their scope, and with bitter
reluctance he commenced to realise that he now saw the
full extent to which his capacity would ever attain. He
might become more certain, more facile, but nothing else.
No longer could he still look forward and upward, confident
in what would be revealed when the summit of the hill he
so laboriously climbed was reached. He was there, and
lo! it was but the crowded tableland of mediocrity!</p>

<p class="indent">His thoughts were bitter as he walked through the streets
that day. Why had Nature so utterly denied him that
divine &quot;something&quot; that no industry can give, no study
can acquire? &quot;I can but despise my own men and women,&quot;
he thought. &quot;I am no creator! I make forms in paint,
but I cannot give them the breath of life. I make them
beautiful&mdash;strictly speaking&mdash;yet there is no beauty in
them. I am a craftsman, a mechanic&mdash;not an artist.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But he had a stout heart and a dogged obstinacy that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
refused to yield. Surely this fervid ambition to abandon
himself to imaginative work must be the outcome of some
fire of inspiration, however small and smouldering. Let him
only find that woman with the gleaming pale face and the
sunlike hair, and he surely could and would produce his
masterpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked around as he walked. Even if he discovered
his personified dream out of the ranks of professional
models, he meant to leave no stone unturned to persuade
her to sit for his great picture.</p>

<p class="indent">He shivered somewhat as the chill winter blasts rushed
by. Money was far from plentiful in Jack&#39;s pockets. In
true artistic style he inhabited a garret in Bohemia, and it
was only by the strictest economy that he was enabled to
exist on the work he sold, aided by the small sum of money
he had inherited from his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet the studio belonging to the top suite in the handsome
block of flats that he entered, and in which he was obviously
quite at home, bore every sign of ample wealth. A spacious
and lofty apartment, it was obviously no makeshift, but
had been destined by its architect to behold artistic labours.
This was clearly shown by its top-lights, and its one very
huge window, unusually wide and deep.</p>

<p class="indent">From the front entrance of the flat of which it formed
part, this studio was reached by crossing a wide hall, on
the left side of which opened the living-rooms of the suite.
But the entire right-hand half of the flat, looking north,
was devoted to the requirements of Art. At the farther
end of the studio itself a door opened on to a short passage
on each side of which was a quite small room. That on the
right was the model&#39;s dressing-room; it communicated
also directly with the studio, but the other little room had
its only opening into the short corridor. It was destined
for the storing of plaster and other materials used in modelling,
and possessed the useful addition of a tiny sink with
hot and cold water. A door at the farther end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
dividing passage gave access to a flight of stairs which
ultimately led out to Langthorne Place, where was the
back entrance of the block of flats.</p>

<p class="indent">The studio itself was verily a fascinating spot, with its
exquisite replicas of classical statues; its curious swords
and armour; its plaques; its Damascus shawls and
Eastern draperies; divans and lavishly carved chairs
and tables. Vases of curious build, harmonious outline,
or rich colour stood around, several&mdash;despite the wintry
season&mdash;filled with pink and crimson roses.</p>

<p class="indent">But for all this luxury, it was obviously a workshop.
The scent of the flowers struggled feebly through the
stronger odour of oils and turpentine, while a couple of the
vases were utilised to hold spiky clusters of innumerable
paint-brushes. The statue of Venus was next to the life-sized
lay figure; the Salviati mirror reflected, besides a
bronze Mercury, a grim skeleton and a plaster cast of a head
with the outer skin removed to show the facial muscles.
Numerous studies and unfinished sketches decorated
or defaced the walls, while heavy-looking books on anatomy
and perspective were to be found by the side of daintily-bound
poets and some of the newest novels. There was
quite enough of dust and disorder to show this <i>atelier</i> to be
the haunt of earnest workers, and the young man, clad in
a much-besmeared painting overall, who stood before a
large canvas, scarcely glanced aside as Jack entered.</p>

<p class="indent">In this industrious artist Jack beheld his best and truest
friend. It was to the good-nature of Geoffrey Danvers that
he owed the privilege of working in this splendid studio from
morning to evening, and making it practically his home; it
was Geoff&#39;s generosity that freed him from any difficulties
concerning the cost of canvas, colours and models.</p>

<p class="indent">Meeting at an Art school in Paris, a close comradeship
had sprung up between the two young Englishmen, and
when Geoff returned to London and took up his abode in
this flat with its fine studio, he was not slow in suggesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
that Jack Hardy should continue to be his brother-in-art.</p>

<p class="indent">He knew his friend&#39;s poverty, knew that without some
such help he would be condemned to waste many of his
days turning out &quot;pot-boilers,&quot; and was heartily glad to be
able to save him from this embittering employment. For
the present, at all events, Jack was quite freed from every
expense connected with his work. He procured all his
materials from Geoff&#39;s colour dealer, and never even saw the
bills, while each week the fee for his model got itself paid
in the same convenient manner.</p>

<p class="indent">But money was indeed scarcely an object to Geoff. He
was possessed of far more than enough for the simple life
that was his choice. He really could not see that any
unusual kindliness or generosity lay in his favourite
diversion of playing &quot;fairy godfather&quot; to other young
artists, clever yet needy. All his aspirations for the
future, all his interest in the present, lay in Art&mdash;his life&#39;s
occupation&mdash;and he pursued it with a devotion, an ardour,
that could not have been surpassed had he known his whole
ultimate welfare to depend upon his success.</p>

<p class="indent">And surely the gods loved Geoffrey Danvers! Not only
did he bring to his labours a brain in which the capacity
for unwearying endeavour co-existed with ever-active
enthusiasm and alert intelligence; more than that&mdash;to him
had been given an imaginative soul that swam easily and
always in a boundless sea of fantasy and dreams. His good
right hand followed instincts, obeyed emotions and upwelling
thoughts, all unguessed-at and undreamed-of by
plodding, heavy-minded Jack Hardy. Thus came forth
work pulsating with that power, that appeal, that life,
for which Jack yearned, that he struggled for, prayed for&mdash;in
vain&mdash;all in vain.</p>

<p class="indent">An hour later the two young men sat down to lunch.
Jack&#39;s opening statement was startling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve seen the most beautiful woman alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;That&#39;s a big order. Your &#39;Belle Dame&#39;? No, you
couldn&#39;t have kept that great fact to yourself for so long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think not. No, it&#39;s that Miss Stornway whom
Flinders spoke of. You remember&mdash;the &#39;Diana&#39; of Montford&#39;s
last year&#39;s Academy picture. She&#39;s sitting for
Towning now. She is lovely&mdash;really. She looks as strong
and lithe and graceful as the goddess herself. Never worn
corsets in her life, I understand. Her face is perfectly
exquisite too&mdash;pure Greek. Her hair waves back from
halfway down her forehead, like that of Venus there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dark, is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Almost black hair, big brown eyes, quite a brunette
really; but one might think she was fair, she has such a
clear complexion, such a smooth, satin-like skin. Go out
to Towning&#39;s and see her. It&#39;s really worth while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll have her to sit here. I can see you are anxious
to paint from her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must confess I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had better write at once then. Since she is such a
paragon of beauty I expect she has a waiting list of engagements.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A couple of days later proved Geoffrey to be a true
prophet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have indeed got to wait our turn, it seems. Miss
Stornway can&#39;t come until the middle of March,&quot; announced
Jack, studying the response to his letter. &quot;Ten weeks
ahead. Why, that is about when you&#39;ll be going away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter at all. If I have got my &#39;Death
of Orpheus&#39; finished I might make a few studies of her, to
use up my last few days here; but she is coming for you,
you know.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXVIII" id="chXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<small>GEOFFREY DANVERS</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> spring morning on which Evarne was to make
her first appearance in this new studio dawned
fresh and crisp. On the outward journey she
purchased a bunch of daffodils, and slipped them
between the revers of her warm squirrel coat. A little cap
of the same grey fur perched itself jauntily upon her thick
hair, beneath which her clear, calm eyes looked forth upon
the world with a certain sweet and serene complacency.</p>

<p class="indent">She had allowed herself more than sufficient time for
finding her goal, and was ushered by an elderly charwoman
into an empty studio. She sat down patiently to wait,
picking up the day&#39;s newspaper to pass the time until Mr.
Hardy should arrive.</p>

<p class="indent">Gradually the feeling assailed her that she was being
watched. At length the conviction became sufficiently
strong to cause her to lower her paper and look round.
There, sure enough, in an open doorway, stood a young man.</p>

<p class="indent">She rose rather suddenly to her feet. This was presumably
Mr. Danvers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excuse my staring so hard,&quot; said Geoff rather awkwardly,
as he came forward. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to startle you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m here to be looked at, you know,&quot; was the smiling
retort, and then a confused silence prevailed.</p>

<p class="indent">Any embarrassment before strangers was an unusual
experience, and Evarne found herself consciously casting
around in her mind for something to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I put my daffodils into water&mdash;I should be sorry
to see them fade?&quot; she asked at length.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
For answer Geoff impulsively seized a bunch of roses
by their unhappy heads, whipped them out of their vase
and flung them aside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put your flowers here,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You need not have done that,&quot; suggested Evarne
somewhat reproachfully. &quot;There was plenty of room for
my daffodils beside your roses.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was another pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you believe in omens?&quot; asked Geoff suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hardly know,&quot; was the uninspiring response.</p>

<p class="indent">Once more came a pause of considerable duration. Conversation
between these two, neither usually gauche or
dull-witted, seemed to consist of brief, somewhat inane
remarks, interlarded with long periods of silence. But
these protracted intervals were strangely devoid of any
unpleasant feeling of restraint.</p>

<p class="indent">Meeting Geoffrey&#39;s grey eyes fixed full upon her, Evarne
instinctively smiled at him, slowly and serenely as was her
wont. The young man rose from his chair with an abrupt
start, and, crossing over to his easel, commenced to sort
out brushes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I, too, am going to paint from you, Miss Stornway,&quot; he
explained with his back to her, &quot;but my friend must
arrange your pose. He has got an order for the picture. I
can&#39;t think what is keeping him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even as he spoke Jack swept in like a whirlwind, full
of explanations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you been here long, Miss Stornway? Well,
never mind, only be as quick as you can in dressing, there&#39;s
a good girl. I want you to wear this. Where on earth is
it? Have you looked at the costume this morning,
Geoff?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Which costume?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The one you helped me twist up yesterday, of
course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From the recesses of the plaster-room Jack produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
what was apparently a white rope, but as he proceeded to
shake it out, it expanded into a loose sleeveless gown. It
was made of almost transparent muslin, and had been
damped, twisted round as tightly as possible while still
wet, and thus left to dry. As a result it was now covered
with innumerable little folds and creases, delightfully
reminiscent of the draperies of antique statues.</p>

<p class="indent">Before to-day had Evarne worn just such a robe, and
knowing that nothing was better calculated to emphasise
her commanding beauty than was this graceful simplicity,
it was with considerable satisfaction that she took it from
Jack&#39;s hand and retired to the model&#39;s room. A white
ribbon was provided to confine the falling folds beneath
her breast; the only touch of colour was the rich blue
of the cornflowers and golden yellow of ripe wheat-ears that
composed a wreath for her head. She did not hurry in the
least over her toilette, but took as much time as ever she
required in arranging her hair graciously beneath the light
garland, and in carefully coaxing and smoothing into artistic
folds the masses of snowy drapery, and moulding it to
her form. She felt strangely, unreasonably excited&mdash;peculiarly
anxious to look her very best for Mr. Hardy&#39;s benefit.
She gazed at her reflection critically ere leaving her retreat,
and having an artist&#39;s eye, her lips inevitably curved into
a soft smile of satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you do look ripping!&quot; exclaimed Jack impulsively,
as she appeared and stood motionless for a moment
to be surveyed.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff was silent, but Evarne&#39;s glance had somehow
wandered towards him, and his eyes had spoken. Half-unconsciously
she gave a tiny happy laugh, as, scorning
the step, she sprang lightly upon the throne.</p>

<p class="indent">Never had a day sped with such magical rapidity. For
the first time in her whole experience as an artist&#39;s model
she was genuinely sorry when twilight fell and work had to
be abandoned. Strangely, strangely attractive was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
mental atmosphere of this studio, wherein luxury and ambition
blossomed side by side.</p>

<p class="indent">She had received in her life not a few personal lessons
concerning the uncertainty of Fate and mutability of
Fortune, while from Philia&#39;s teachings she had learned it
all over again second-hand. As the old woman put it&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yer goes out innercent and unsuspectin&#39; for a quiet
walk, and perhaps you&#39;re brought &#39;ome on a shutter dead as
a doornail, from a chimney-pot &#39;avin fallen and cracked yer
skull; or you&#39;ve been squashed by a motor; or shot by a
lunatic; or bit by a mad dog. All them things &#39;appens
to some folks. Maybe your turn next, maybe mine. Or,
more ordinary like, a bit o&#39; grit blows into yer eye all in the
twinklin&#39; of a second&mdash;no warnin&#39; at all&mdash;and yer goes
gropin&#39; &#39;arf-blind for the rest of the day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne returned home that evening with a metaphorical
&quot;bit o&#39; grit&quot; having blown in her eye, &quot;in a twinkling of
a second&mdash;no warning at all.&quot; Many a studio had she
entered, many an artist had she known, clever, young and
attractive, who had been kind and considerate to her, even
as Geoffrey Danvers. What quality did he possess in any
superlative degree to mark him out from all others? What
was there about him that awoke such&mdash;well&mdash;such a keen
and ardent interest in her mind, not only for himself and
his work, but for everything with which he was even remotely
connected? He had not said or done anything
at all original or particularly interesting, yet she found herself
dwelling upon his every word, every action, recalling
and musing upon his most casual unprofessional glance.</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps, after all, the deep and engrossing impression
he had made was but the natural outcome of the ardent
admiration she had felt for those of his paintings that were
still in the studio. Instantly had she realised that here was
work of no common order&mdash;that there was a combination
of charm and of force, an instinct for the dramatic, together
with a certain dreamy mysticism, a poetic treatment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
daring realism, that could not possibly have been evolved
by a banal, uninteresting mind. Surely a man&#39;s self can
often be better read in his works than by years of ordinary
acquaintanceship?</p>

<p class="indent">When Philia made her usual inquiries regarding the
personal appearance of these new employers, Evarne had
described Jack Hardy well enough, but her recollection of
Geoff was apparently vague.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well&mdash;let me think&mdash;he has fair hair, but he is clean-shaven,
and he was dressed in light grey.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is nothing much to tell, really. He is a bit taller
than I am&mdash;I noticed that when he stood up on the throne
to make some alteration in my wreath. When he is working
he wears a painting overall of blue linen, which betrays
vanity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pore young man. Why should yer say that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sure he knows the colour suits him. Now, Mr.
Hardy only has brown holland.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is Mr. Danvers good-looking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne reflected a moment, then temporised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought so,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p class="indent">Days came and passed. A whole week went by, but her
mental vision in no way recovered its normal equipoise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whatever &#39;as took yer, Evarne?&quot; inquired Philia at
supper one evening, when some blatant act of absent-mindedness
proclaimed that her companion&#39;s thoughts
were far away. &quot;There&#39;s no tellin&#39; now what you&#39;ll be up
to next. You&#39;re anticking about jist as if you&#39;d fallen in
love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fallen in love!&quot; Evarne had never liked that term;
it had seemed to her somewhat cheap and light. But, after
all, was it not strangely descriptive&mdash;full of realism?
Only last week she and &quot;that other&quot; had been total
strangers. Now&mdash;ah! now&mdash;what a difference! Only a
few mutual glances; a tender pressure of the hand; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
stolen smile, so full of meaning&mdash;at once the whole world
bore a different face, was lit by a new glory; all life&#39;s hopes
and possibilities sprung forth anew, richly scented, brightly
hued. &quot;Fallen in love&quot; indeed! What other imaginable
phrase could so forcefully express both the suddenness and
the personal irresponsibility of that which had brought to
pass this all-wondrous change?</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne pictured love as a seething, rushing torrent. It
had nigh drowned her in a maelstrom once, but she had
scrambled out, and the last drop of its cruel waters had long
since dried from her garments. Now she had walked quietly
along as if on its flat, dull, safe banks for many a year,
merely smiling serenely, somewhat scornfully, at those
who&mdash;dabbling their feet where its eddies were calm and
shallow&mdash;had stretched forth their hands, inviting her to
join them in their child&#39;s play. But in the fated hour a
pair of grey eyes had gazed up at her from out the depths
of the stream; she had looked a moment too long, too
intently, and had fallen sheer into the flood and was swept
helplessly along in its wild current. Surely it was far safer
to retain one&#39;s balance always and ever, to keep a steady
head and avoid even this divine fall? Mayhap! Yet
so far&mdash;drifting lightly and unresistingly&mdash;she could not
regret. The touch of these waters was indeed pleasant;
they tasted sweet within her mouth. Rocks there were
indeed&mdash;cruel, menacing boulders&mdash;yet she came not nigh
them. Surely it was better here, far better, despite dangers
cruel and manifold, than on those level arid banks.</p>

<p class="indent">A fortnight glided by, and not a day but saw fresh verses
added to the poem of which these two had, all unconsciously,
composed the opening stanzas at the very moment of their
first meeting. So far this song of love ran in simple cadence&mdash;easy
of construction and rhythm. Not a line had
yet been sent forth into the air. Strophe and antistrophe
were sung in silence, yet with perfect mutual comprehension
and harmony.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
Never since those first few minutes&mdash;given over to apparent
tongue-tied embarrassment&mdash;had Geoffrey and
Evarne been together without Jack making a third. While
this was certainly in the ordinary course of events, it was
also, in some degree, the outcome of deliberate design on
Jack&#39;s part. That young man had the greatest fear of
love. He viewed it with apprehension and misgiving, a
disease, a madness, to be warded off and avoided desperately&mdash;at
all events by an artist. He might not know very
much about the matter, or the symptoms by which it made
its terrible presence manifest, but very soon indeed he was
assailed by an alarming suspicion that Geoff regarded Miss
Stornway differently from other models, dangerously
differently.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack was uneasy. He felt a sort of responsibility for
having introduced the young woman into the studio, much
as he would have held himself guilty had he brought home
fever from one of his searches for &quot;La Belle Dame,&quot; and
thus prostrated his friend upon a bed of sickness. He had
a vague idea that his presence might somehow suffice to
nip any growing feeling of affection in the bud. Thus he
conscientiously hovered around.</p>

<p class="indent">And Geoffrey&mdash;a prey to many conflicting emotions&mdash;raised
no objection. There were reasons that made it very
desirable that he should not grow to seriously care for this
fascinating model. Not being of a nature that could treat
emotional matters lightly, for some time his delight in
Evarne&#39;s presence was largely diluted by an ardent wish
that he had never seen her fair face. But this marvellous
wisdom did not have things all its own way.</p>

<p class="indent">The date was rapidly approaching when he had arranged
to leave England. Geoff&#39;s two young travelling
companions were continually dropping in, full of eager talk
of the journey and the work that was going to be accomplished
at Venice. Day by day his gradually growing
dislike of this proposed absence from London increased.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
At length a mental crisis came. His many conflicting
thoughts settled themselves into a resolution.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Jack,&quot; he announced one evening, &quot;you had
better go to Venice with those boys. I have just made up
my mind that I&#39;m not going. You can be ready in three
days, can&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack absolutely gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not? Why are you not going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I prefer to stop in England. I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I suppose
I may as well tell you. There&#39;s no reason for secrecy.
I&#39;ve seen the woman I want to marry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack tried to look mystified and at a loss, as if thereby
he could ward off the evil hour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who is it?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, you blind old bat, who should it be but&mdash;Miss
Stornway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The blow had fallen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Geoffrey Danvers!&quot; and Jack&#39;s voice was full of horror.
&quot;You must not be so idiotic!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young man laughed lightly as he answered&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Object, argue and discuss as much as you like. I&#39;ll
talk to you for hours about her. Why should I not marry
that sweet girl? Tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, after all she&#39;s only a&mdash;only a&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only a model! What on earth has that got to do with it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a very serious objection on earth, whatever it
may be in heaven,&quot; retorted Jack, flattering himself he had
been rather smart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And don&#39;t you know where marriages are made? I
tell you she is the one woman Heaven intended for me.
Don&#39;t think I love her only for her beauty&mdash;though she is
lovely beyond all words. But if her eyes were small and
squinting, yet had that same beautiful soul shining out
of them&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack interrupted. Even his limited imagination was
capable of supplying the conclusion of this sentiment.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
&quot;Look here, Geoff! Do see reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I prefer to see Evarne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you cannot&mdash;you must not&mdash;marry an artist&#39;s
model whom you haven&#39;t known for three weeks&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a mere detail. It&#39;s my misfortune, isn&#39;t it,
not my fault, that I didn&#39;t meet her years ago? As to her
being a model&mdash;what of it? It&#39;s an honest enough profession
when a girl is obliged to earn her own living, and
you know when her father died and left her penniless she
had to do something. Everybody knows that needlework
is a starving occupation, and I think that old woman who
suggested her taking up this business was a paragon of
wisdom. There&#39;s nothing at all in Miss Stornway&#39;s life
that anyone could take exception to, unless they were
utterly bigoted. You can&#39;t find any story to her discredit
in any studio, or on the lips of any artist. Everyone
speaks well of her, she is entirely admirable&mdash;brave,
beautiful&mdash;&mdash;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she&#39;s a nice girl enough, and I don&#39;t doubt she&#39;s
straight as a die. But don&#39;t&mdash;don&#39;t rush into this affair
madly and hastily. You were going to Venice. Well, for
goodness&#39; sake go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will, later on, and take Evarne with me. I say, I
take it all very much for granted, don&#39;t I? But she does
care for me&mdash;you think she does, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack discreetly suppressed the retort that rose to his
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How can I tell? But, of course, I meant go alone to
Italy, to test the reality of your feelings. Six months out
of a lifetime&mdash;why, it&#39;s nothing, if it be really an affair
for a lifetime. And if absence shows it to be but a passing
fancy&mdash;well, you will have done no harm to her or to yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I didn&#39;t see her for twenty years, I should never
change, never forget her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And it&#39;s only six months that&#39;s in question. If she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
really is the woman above all others for you, then, I&#39;d say,
make her your wife even if she were a beggar in the streets.
But be sure first, Geoff! You&#39;re twenty-six now&mdash;not a
hot-brained boy. Do submit your fancy to this small
test before you fly in the face of society. You know what a
general row there will be, and how all your own set will
disapprove. You are the heir to a title, though you never
seem to remember it, so that your marriage is a matter of
real importance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve thought of all that. Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve overlooked
any of the arguments my family would be sure to bring up.
But I am not going to let my vague prospects make any
serious difference in my life. Why, I dare say the title
will never come to me. Winborough quite easily might
live longer than I.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s hardly likely since he&#39;s about a quarter of a century
older. Anyway, there&#39;s the possibility, not to say the
likelihood, that your wife will one day find herself a countess,
and that your son will be the future Earl of Winborough.
It really is no light matter, old fellow. Don&#39;t
disappoint these boys; go to Venice with them, and see
how you feel toward Miss Stornway when you come
back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And have some other lucky beggar with more gumption
carrying her off in the meanwhile?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she married anyone else in six months it would most
certainly prove that she had not got the same true depth
of feeling for you that you have for her. You ought to be
sure, both of yourself and of her, before you make her your
wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Jack continued, arguing and discussing, talking
the profoundest of common sense, yet with enough of
sympathy to add weight to his words. And again Geoffrey
saw the dark side of the shield, noticed the shadows athwart
the roseate path. Finally he resolved not to alter his plans
for the summer. Six months would soon be gone, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
passing of this time of test would sweep the last lingering
scruples from his mind.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a serious matter, and ought to be treated seriously.
I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve resolved to go,&quot; was his ultimate
conclusion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall often write to you, Evarne,&quot; he declared, holding
the girl&#39;s hands as they bade each other farewell. &quot;You
will answer my letters, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not look up, not able to trust herself to meet
his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied very meekly, yet gloriously gladdened
at heart. &quot;I will write if you wish me to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Impulsively Geoffrey bent down and kissed first one of
the hands he held and then the other. Thus they parted.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXIX" id="chXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br />
<small>SEKHET SMILES</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Until</span> the end of the week Evarne posed for Jack
Hardy alone. She had now acquired an entirely
fresh interest and new importance in that
young man&#39;s eyes, and he exerted himself to
amuse and cheer her during these early days of separation.
Geoffrey was not much mentioned between them. Prudence
on the one side, and an instinctive restraint on the
other, prevented this. Nevertheless, Evarne was conscious
of an added loss when she left this studio to sit for a woman
artist, and her surroundings were no longer imbued with
the magnetism of the absent one.</p>

<p class="indent">But letters from Geoff promptly proceeded to rain down
upon her. Within twenty-four hours of his quitting London
came a brief note, and apparently his first act on reaching
Venice was to write to her for the second time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall let four full days go by before I answer,&quot; she
decided. But ere that time had passed, a third very
lengthy epistle had arrived, which concluded with the
gentlest of reproaches for her unkind negligence in not
replying sooner. Thus, when she did sit down after supper
one evening to write her first letter to Geoffrey, many pages
covered with his handwriting were spread out before her
gaze.</p>

<p class="indent">The correspondence thus commenced rapidly developed
into the most engrossing, enthralling, and delightful feature
in the existence of these two. They exchanged ideas,
sympathies, experiences, hopes and fears; and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
uttermost frankness on any and every subject but served
to show with increased emphasis how harmonious were
their innermost natures, how naturally their minds trod
the same paths.</p>

<p class="indent">Both wrote well and easily, although for some time
Evarne, with true feminine discretion, retained a firm grip
upon the too frank display of the strength of her affection
for Geoffrey. But the days in which she forbade her
written words to adequately express what she felt were
very speedily left behind. As to the young man himself,
all his cautious scruples had exhausted themselves in
leading him out of England. From the first he was
troubled by few restrictions, and within a month he was
avowedly writing love letters.</p>

<p class="indent">He had never made any abrupt and startling declaration
of his feelings, let alone of his intentions. It was just a
case of swift yet easy drifting. He appeared to deem it a
matter of course that Evarne knew and recognised the fact
that he loved her, and that all else was to be taken for
granted. She was both amused and attracted by this
simple and unobtrusive change in their correspondence
from comparative formality to tender truth. She expressed
no surprise, but took it all quietly and without comment.
Indeed, it seemed really but a natural and ordinary thing
that she and Geoffrey should acknowledge their love. It
was a continuance of a pretence of mere friendship between
them that would have seemed extraordinary. To abandon
any disguise was not only easy and comforting&mdash;it was
instinctive.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus all those fresh vague thoughts, those dominating
and ardent emotions that love brings into being, and which
suppression causes to torture the brain wherein they are
conceived, were granted free scope and outlet in the heart-to-heart
letters that they wrote so gladly one to another.
And their love grew and strengthened steadily from this
use and outgiving.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
It had been some time before Evarne had got to the
point of responding with equal frankness to Geoff&#39;s ardent
epistles, but she did arrive at last.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You tell me to think of you, Geoff,&quot; she sat happily
writing one evening. &quot;I do, indeed I do, remember you as
steadily as even you yourself could possibly desire. To say
I think of you every hour is not enough&mdash;you are never out
of my mind or my heart, night and day. I don&#39;t mean that
I think actively and consciously of you <i>quite</i> all the time,
but the sense of your personality, the deep thought of you,
is <i>incessantly</i> with me. It has become a part of my mind,
I fancy; for I think of you without realising it, simultaneously
with thinking deliberately of other matters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have no fear. I love you&mdash;love you utterly! I never
seem to get tired now, however long the day; for the hours
fade into nothingness in dreams of you. You know how
ready all we lazy models are to jump down from the throne
directly &#39;time&#39; is called? Now I often surprise people
by not moving when the magic word is spoken. I have not
heard it, for I have been&mdash;where?&mdash;out in Venice&mdash;or in
Paradise&mdash;I know not; but wherever the place may be,
I have been with you! How, then, can I be expected to
hear, unless people shout to startle me back to earth? In
the &#39;rests&#39; I read as usual, or, to be exact, not as usual;
for often on reaching the end of a page I become aware
that I know nothing at all of what it is about&mdash;the thought
of you, my dear tormentor, has come &#39;twixt me and the
words, and for very shame&#39;s sake I have had to start again
and try to banish you for just a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whatever you find to say to Mr. Danvers is more than
I can make out,&quot; declared Philia, as Evarne, having completed
writing her letter, proceeded to put its pages into
order. &quot;You scribbles sheets and sheets, and every day
almost&mdash;why, you writes books, and &#39;e&#39;s as bad. If I was
the postman I wouldn&#39;t &#39;ave it! Now, jist look at the size
of that billy-do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
The young woman made a little grimace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is rather long, isn&#39;t it? But the difficulty does not
lie in finding what to say. It is in obliging one&#39;s self to
stop.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you goin&#39; to marry &#39;im, Evarne?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I suppose that is an allowable question? I don&#39;t....
No! I believe&mdash;how can I tell? I never think
of anything ahead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give me somethin&#39; I can swoller better&#39;n that. &#39;Ow
startled you look. What&#39;s to prevent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Marrying! That&#39;s&mdash;oh, he will marry someone of his
own rank.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on with yer. Ain&#39;t you a laidy&mdash;a perfect laidy,
says I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m an artist&#39;s model. Nothing more nor less,&quot; was the
somewhat haughtily spoken rejoinder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I &#39;opes to goodness you&#39;ll be careful what yer
writes. It&#39;s a jolly dangerous game, I tell yer, puttin&#39;
silly talk into writin&#39; and then chuckin&#39; it into the pillar-box.
Lord only knows what may come to it before it&#39;s
safely burned or tored up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You unromantic old dear! What harm do you think
can come of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;E could spoil your chance, if &#39;e was so minded, with
any other gentleman as might want to marry yer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That doesn&#39;t frighten me. Is there nothing
else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Ow can I tell? I ain&#39;t no Mother Shipton. But I
knows well enough it ain&#39;t a wise thing for a girl to do.
There ain&#39;t a day as passes without reckless letters making
trouble for someone or other.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it an equally unwise proceeding for men too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, my gosh, it jist is. Never &#39;eard of breach o&#39;
promise cases? Nobody didn&#39;t ought to trust nobody in
this &#39;ere wicked world. If yer contents yerself with jist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
speaking like an idjit, you can always deny it afterwards&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But when you&#39;ve bin and gorn and acted like a born
natural, by puttin&#39; the stuff into writin&#39;, well, &#39;tain&#39;t no
use denying it then. You&#39;re done for. &#39;Out damned
lines&#39;&mdash;Shakespeare! But they don&#39;t come out&mdash;not
for all the cussin&#39; and swearin&#39; in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne laughed outright.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s true enough. I know it, and of course Geoff
must know it too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, &#39;e&#39;s a hartist. They don&#39;t know nothin&#39;, none
of &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Geoff knows he can trust me, Philia, and I value and
appreciate the blessed belief he shows in me by writing as
he does. Perfect love casteth out fear of every description.
He believes that I shall know the right thing to do with
regard to his letters, and that I shall ever and always do
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It don&#39;t need much wit for anyone to know they&#39;re safe
in your &#39;ands, my dear. But do you write to &#39;im jist all
that comes into yer &#39;ead, trustin&#39; &#39;im to know the right
thing to do, and do it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed yes&mdash;oh yes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s the very frame o&#39; mind as ruins &#39;undreds o&#39;
girls. You git rid of it, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won&#39;t. I shan&#39;t even try. No&quot;&mdash;and a wilful head
was shaken vigorously&mdash;&quot;I shan&#39;t pay any attention to
your sage advice, not the&mdash;least&mdash;little bit. Not trust
Geoff absolutely and entirely! Why, I&#39;d as soon mistrust
myself. Though I ought to know better by now&mdash;oh,
indeed, I ought!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bitter thoughts of past blind trust made ridiculous,
brought a note of anguish to the low, sweet voice. But
she went on almost defiantly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I like to write to him recklessly, and without a single
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
thought of possible future regret. It pleases me to think
that he possesses letters of mine that people might say a
woman should only have written to the man who was to
be her husband. I like to feel that he and I are, to a certain
extent, in one another&#39;s power&mdash;dependent each on the
other&#39;s honour. Through those letters he has seen into the
innermost recesses of my soul, in a way that no other human
being has done. Think, when you truly love, of the delight
that lies in such abandonment. But don&#39;t you trouble,
Philia. I&#39;ve not told him everything&mdash;not shown him quite
the full extent of all I feel for him. There is still plenty in
reserve. There remain sealed chambers that will not open
readily.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, everyone must go their own ways in sich matters.
&#39;Tain&#39;t no use advisin&#39;. Common sense and love never
seems to flourish longside o&#39; one another, more&#39;s the pity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, love is not a question of &#39;reason.&#39; It is just
&#39;unreason.&#39; Surely it is better to grasp that truth at once,
and so reconcile one&#39;s self to thinking and acting quite
unreasonably?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you silly young fool!&quot; snorted Philia as she
lit her candle preparatory to retiring to bed.</p>

<p class="indent">On the threshold of the door she stopped and looked back;
Evarne was gazing across at her with a sweet smile playing
around her eyes and lips. The old woman shook her fist
in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You silly young&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She stopped abruptly, sighed,
and shook her head portentously. Then in a changed
voice: &quot;My gosh, but &#39;ow I envies yer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She banged the door violently, and went slowly upstairs.
Evarne remained for a few minutes rapt in deep thought.
Then, rousing herself, she pressed each individual page of
her letter to her lips, folded it up with scrupulous care and
exactness, and went out to the post.</p>

<p class="indent">Many a year had passed since she had known such perfect
peace and satisfaction as that which now coloured and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
perfumed the routine of her days. Living in the present
only, she held in her clasp practically all that is needed for
happiness. Since her first success as a model she had
suffered no physical deprivation such as had characterised
that hateful year spent at needlework, but only now were
her emotional and intellectual requirements equally and at
one time satisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">This voluminous correspondence with Geoff was in every
way delightful. They thought and wrote much upon
topics not altogether personal, Evarne bringing her whole
intellect as well as her heart to bear upon the composition
of her letters, and, for the first time for many years, revelling
in communion with a mind at least equally as reflective
and well-informed as was her own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What should I have done,&quot; she wondered, as she
dropped her letter into the pillar-box, &quot;supposing that,
loving Geoff as I do, he had not cared for me, and had never
wanted to write? I should have died! I don&#39;t mean
really and truly, I suppose, but my heart would have
drooped, my hope and energy and happiness would have
faded. I can never be too grateful to him&mdash;no, never&mdash;for
saving me from so much suffering.&quot; Then she smiled
softly. &quot;Sekhet is gracious and good to me again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She walked home with that free, light step that betokens
unlimited vitality and buoyancy of spirit. First-love
may be indeed unique, unapproachable, but that which
is born later in life&mdash;the emotion springing from the rich,
ripe heart and brain, the ardent affection of the human
being in the fullest physical and mental perfection&mdash;is
every whit as dominating, and it is more inspiring, ample
and satisfying than that which came when the heart was
young and life a fairy-tale. Evarne had blossomed forth
afresh beneath this renewal of love, which had led her
again from the monotony of shade out into the vivifying
heat of the sun and the glory of white light.</p>

<p class="indent">The power of intense loving was perhaps her greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
and most perfect force. It was not of the type that can be
portioned out into a series of petty passions. Since Morris
died to her, she had met with none other who held the
secret by which to possess himself of that unlimited fund
of devotion lying dormant and neglected. Some of her
best and most desirable years had melted away devoid
of all emotional interests, and simply to feel herself loved&mdash;to
have her long-unneeded capacity for loving called again
into active use&mdash;was all-sufficient to create the most perfect
happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">Her whole nature reawoke, rejoiced and sang, not merely
because her love was returned&mdash;though from that certainty
sprang triumph and the sweet exaltation ever attendant
upon this greatest of all possible successes&mdash;but
because she herself once more gave her love lavishly. For
the present this was all-sufficient. She rarely thought of
what must be its result&mdash;what ultimate end could be attained.
Blinded by the light of the never-setting brilliance
that now lit her path, she could see clearly only what
was close at hand, and that was indeed fair. She would not
look backwards over that long stretch of desert-land to
where lay that dark and fearful forest, with its hidden
morasses, evil haunts and poisoned plants through which,
led by the hand of Sekhet in cruel mood, her track had
passed long since. Against her better judgment, against her
will even, Hope unfurled his wings again within her breast.
Why endeavour to look forward into the ever-shrouded
and unknowable future? She lived only for the present,
and in that she rejoiced.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXX" id="chXXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX<br />
<small>A GREAT RESOLVE</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of three months she sat again to Jack
Hardy. He wrote an imploring appeal that she
would somehow contrive to spare time for him
just to put her arms and hands into a wondrous
allegorical picture he was painting. She did arrange it,
for not only were all Geoff&#39;s friends her special care, but
she wanted to behold that dear studio again. She was also
rather curious to see young Frank Pallister, of whom Geoffrey
had spoken as sharing it with Jack during its rightful
owner&#39;s absence.</p>

<p class="indent">She found him to be a rosy, fair-haired, somewhat
smartly-clad youth, looking even younger than his twenty
careless years. His work was distinctly promising, but
at present quite elementary&mdash;very much that of an Art-student.
Still, he was but a boy, and, being fairly well-to-do,
would probably not have fretted over his still sadly
low standard of execution had he not been goaded onwards
by a gadfly of another type from that by which Jack was so
constantly harried.</p>

<p class="indent">In one of the smartest squares in the West-end of London
resided a certain dainty damsel with a stern, unreasonable
dragon of a father. Maudie Meridith, in her seventeen-year-old
wisdom, fully agreed with Pallister that they were
both of ample age to be at least engaged&mdash;even if not actually
married. Stern, prosaic dragon of a father begged
to differ. After many prayers, many pleadings, he had
given vent to this appalling ultimatum&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&quot;When you can show me your name in the catalogue
of any of the big exhibitions, my boy, I&#39;ll consent to your
engagement with this baby. Otherwise, you will have to
wait until she is actually twenty years of age. Cruelty
to children, isn&#39;t it? Be off with you both, and don&#39;t
bother me again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The youthful suitor had confided this unheard-of tyranny
to Geoff, for whom he cherished an affectionate admiration.
The response had been to the effect that if Pallister was wise
he would not shoot himself or even sink into a decline, but
would see about endeavouring to fulfil the conditions that
would shorten these three years of probation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If, as you say, you are unalterably convinced that Art
schools keep you back, you had better go and work every
day in my studio,&quot; Geoff had written. &quot;It is a big one,
as you know, and only Jack Hardy is there at present.
You would find him an enormous help to you&mdash;but don&#39;t
bother him, there&#39;s a good lad. If you want to try your
hand at a picture right away, there is ample room on the
throne for two models; if you think a few months hard
preliminary work would be of most value, you can make
studies from Jack&#39;s model. Good luck to you in any case.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This kind offer had been accepted, and every morning
Pallister punctually appeared and painted away steadily
for a few hours. He did not know the meaning of real hard
work, but under the influence of Jack&#39;s friendly aid and
advice he certainly improved week by week.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne found a certain satisfaction in being again in
Geoff&#39;s own home, despite his absence, and although his
name was scarcely mentioned. On the wall was a painting
of him done by Jack a year or so previously. It was a
marvellously good likeness, although the background and
accessories were unfinished. Portrait-painting was Jack&#39;s
<i>forte</i>, would he but have believed it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m going to smuggle away that picture of Mr. Danvers
when you are not looking,&quot; declared Evarne; whereupon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
Jack, when he paid her at the conclusion of her sittings,
smilingly handed her also the canvas in question already
tied up to be taken away.</p>

<p class="indent">She hung it in her room, with a little bracket on either
side, whereon stood vases which she kept filled with fresh
flowers. Night and morning she pressed a gentle kiss upon
the painted lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come back soon, Geoff&mdash;come back soon,&quot; she once
whispered impulsively. And perhaps her wish was wafted
away over land and sea to the City in the Waters, for within
four months of leaving England Geoff had endured quite
sufficient of this test of absence. Thus he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dearest, dearest beyond all expression</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am returning home the day after to-morrow!
Sweetest lady that heart ever adored, I am coming
back to see you, to breathe the same air with you, to tread
the same pavements, to kiss your hands, your lips, your feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you welcome me? I left England loving you....
I thought, to the uttermost of my capacity. Perhaps
it was so then; but now I love you ... oh,
infinitely more ... because I think of you always....
your exquisite letters have taught me to know you
far more perfectly; and all knowledge, all thinking, leads
only to fresh love.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In a way, I shrink from meeting you again. I am fearful
now. In you is all the good and true, the pure and
beauteous. How can I or any man be worthy of you?
Suppose, after a while, I read disappointment in your face?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But be kind to me, gentle and compassionate. I kneel
at your feet, and beg you to give yourself to me and to take
me for your own, heart and mind and body, for ever and
ever. No other woman could ever be my wife, Evarne,
for no other woman could I love.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;May God bless you!</p>

<p class="author">&quot;<span class="smcap">Geoff.</span>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
Evarne let this letter drop on the table, then bowed her
head upon it in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&mdash;what am I to do?&quot; she murmured after a long
pause, filled with a turmoil of mingled bliss and suffering.
Had she been perfectly free to follow the promptings of
her own heart, not one moment for reflection would have
been needed. As it was, a secret indestructible, albeit so
well-guarded&mdash;seemed to rise up as a hideous, pitiless
spectre, bidding her set aside any idea of a future spent with
Geoffrey.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see now&mdash;didn&#39;t I know it before?&mdash;I ought never,
never, to have let him grow to care so much for me,&quot; she
thought, weighed down by genuine though somewhat tardy
remorse.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw that utter selfishness had ruled her so far, with
the result that now it was not only&mdash;not chiefly&mdash;her own
happiness that was at stake, but that of one for whom no
sacrifice could be too great to be sweet.</p>

<p class="indent">In the abstract, the memory of the three years she had
spent with Morris Kenyon formed no burden upon her
conscience. Versed in the secrets of her own heart&mdash;strong
in the certain knowledge of the generous, even if misguided,
motives that had prevailed with her&mdash;she had been absolved
at the bar of her most earnest and sincere judgment
from all stain of deliberate doing of evil. How was it
possible that she should find cause to reproach or condemn
herself, remembering that supreme hour of test, when she
had held so loyally fast to her innate convictions of what
was right and what was not; when she had refused to
barter a mockery of love for the reality of continued wealth
and protection? She thought, too, of her life since then,
chaste amid greater temptations than a man would ever
realise. Deep in her heart was the feeling that she had
been tried and not found wanting. Surely, then, she was
every whit as fitted as any ordinarily spotless woman to
marry a good man?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
Still, so long as the likelihood of such a desire on her part
had seemed far remote, she had been firmly convinced that
she would never allow herself to become a wife with her
secret unconfessed. But now she was faced by a problem&mdash;a
torturing doubt&mdash;that was quite unforeseen. Would it
not be morally a greater wickedness, an additional wrong,
should she remorselessly shatter such perfect trust; smear
and deface the happiness of this man who loved her so
ardently, revered and honoured her with such glad confidence?</p>

<p class="indent">Was it indeed Honour&#39;s command that she should dig
up this loathsome, long-buried corpse, to thrust it under
those very nostrils wherein it would most stink? Was
such a cruel and unscrupulous bowing down to the conventional
idea of right and wrong unquestionably Love&#39;s
duty? She had never been much guided by mere convention.
Was she to begin now when so much was at
stake? Surely not.</p>

<p class="indent">She started suddenly from her chair in bewilderment
and distress, and commenced to pace the room. What
ought she to do? Earnestly she tried to put all care for
herself and for her own desires out of her mind&mdash;to think
only of Geoff. Setting great importance upon the emotional
side of life, she scarcely heeded any difference of
position that might exist between herself and him. Unconscious
of his future prospects, believing his marriage
to be a matter concerning himself alone, her one doubt and
difficulty lay in how best to cope with her hidden past.</p>

<p class="indent">Reason and common sense bade her guard her secret in
silence, now and forever. But her feelings told her plainly
enough that never could she hope to know perfect peace
until she had confessed this thing&mdash;confessed, implored and
obtained forgiveness. But would that not be an end of all
peace of mind for Geoffrey&mdash;ah, poor Geoff! She had
learnt his nature so well. His was a love that gloried in
placing the beloved upon a lofty height, there to be crowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
with stars and worshipped. Could she thrust him out of
his paradise?</p>

<p class="indent">If she shattered his natural and spontaneous love, would
a fresh type, all unknown to him now&mdash;that which is
founded on pity and kindly indulgence&mdash;rise from out the
ruins? Suppose not? What if that other kind of love&mdash;tender
and divine though it may be&mdash;was impossible for
him? She did not fear that he would repulse her cruelly
and scornfully&mdash;that he could never do, surely. But
suppose his love was killed, while hers remained alive?
Ah! Merciful heavens!</p>

<p class="indent">With eyes filled by a sudden horror she stopped short
before the painting of Geoff that hung upon the wall.
Long she gazed, and her wild glance grew gentle with
unutterable affection&mdash;with an almost maternal yearning.
Would life be endurable were it not henceforth consecrated
to this man? Ten thousand times no! Both heart and
intellect anguished to be allowed full scope to expend their
uttermost capacities in the service of love.</p>

<p class="indent">And was she not verily endowed with gifts both mental
and physical that would enable her to make existence
infinitely more delightful, more full, interesting and complete
for him, than could possibly be his lot with Art for
his sole mistress? Surely herein lay her foreordained life&#39;s
work? Who could be so cruel, so pitiless, as to wish her to
be made an outcast from this her heritage? She stretched
forth her hands imploringly to the dear pictured face.
Would he wish it? Oh, surely not! She felt now that
her very cause for existence was explained&mdash;she had discovered
the end whereunto she had been created&mdash;the
duty for which she had been placed on earth, and for the
more perfect fulfilment of which every previous experience
of her life, glad or sorry, had been but essential preliminary
training.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff was sweet-natured indeed, and ever kindly, yet
all artistic temperaments need understanding. It would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
require true insight and discretion, perchance a deal of
patience and forbearance, to render any lifelong union
naught but an added inspiration, an unfailing stimulus,
an additional happiness to this now ardent lover. Could
there be any other woman more fitted to this task than she
was herself&mdash;more capable of taking Geoff&#39;s whole existence
into her tender keeping, and thereby blessing and
enriching it day by day?</p>

<p class="indent">Surely if he never learnt this&mdash;her one and only secret&mdash;it
would be impotent as if it had no existence? And never
would it be revealed to him by outside agency; at least,
so far as human foresight could discern. Who among
those who had known the truth in those bygone years
was in the least likely to again cross her path? Not a
single individual. Surely it would be well for Geoffrey to
be so far deceived&mdash;to be tricked, and, if necessary, lied to
on this one point? Would not his ultimate greatest
happiness be thereby ensured? Since he wished her for
his wife, should he not have his will? Looking to her
unhesitatingly for all the good and true, the pure and
beauteous in womanhood&mdash;was he to be disillusioned?</p>

<p class="indent">Long and earnestly she reflected, endeavouring to weigh
impartially and fairly every argument favouring confession.
If Geoffrey could know, would he deem this
secrecy to be her crowning blemish&mdash;the greatest, most
personal and unforgivable wrong of all? Not if he could
read her heart, and judge by her motives. Her own welfare
was indeed not first in her mind. The shielding of his
happiness was verily her chief thought. Alas, that deception
should be necessary for its preservation&mdash;yet surely
this was so? Alas!  alas!</p>

<p class="indent">At length the final doubt ceased to clamour. The decision
had been protracted and difficult. It left her lovely
face somewhat drawn and pale; but in her soft, eloquent
eyes gleamed a light almost superhuman in its intensity
of love and desperate resolution.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
&quot;What would I not do, dare, defy for your sake, my
best and dearest?&quot; she murmured aloud. &quot;Never, while
I have strength and power to ward it off, will I bring grief
and suffering and agony of mind into your life. Never!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXI" id="chXXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br />
<small>JOURNEYS END IN LOVERS&#39; MEETINGS</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning came another little note from
Geoffrey. He would arrive in London at noon
that day. When and where could they meet?
Would she come to the studio as soon as her
day&#39;s work was over? Might he come to see her, or should
they meet out-of-doors somewhere? Anything she decided&mdash;though
she was implored not to put him off until
to-morrow. Would she please telegraph?</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne looked across the breakfast table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Philia, in what costume do I look nicest of all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The answer was prompt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You looks nicest of all in yer own skin, and nothin&#39; else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that hardly does for this occasion, all the same.
I&#39;m going to supper with&mdash;with Geoff.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beg yer parding. &#39;E&#39;s really &#39;ome, then? Wear anythin&#39;
yer choose. &#39;E won&#39;t never notice!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne feared she was a most restless and impatient
model that day. The hours seemed interminable. But
they were got through somehow, and at seven o&#39;clock in
the evening she stepped from a hansom and proceeded to
mount the three flights of broad stairs that led up to the
studio. Her heart was throbbing so wildly that even
before the first landing was reached her breath came with
difficulty, and a feeling almost of faintness obliged her to
stand still for a few moments, to reconquer some degree
of calmness.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
The door of Geoff&#39;s flat was already wide open, and just
within the hall stood the young man himself, awaiting her
coming. The instant he caught the first glimpse of her
approaching, he bounded downstairs and seized both the
hands she held out to him.</p>

<p class="indent">For a minute they stood motionless and speechless,
more than content to once again feast their eyes upon one
another&#39;s faces. Then, still without a word, they mounted
the last flight of stairs, holding hands like children, and the
door of the flat closed behind them.</p>

<p class="indent">They were alone together for the first time.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne went into the sitting-room. The curtains were
drawn, and two rose-pink shaded lamps cast a warm,
softening glow upon the heavy oak furniture. Calmly
enough she took off her hat, carefully stuck in the pins, and
placed it on a chair. Then she turned round suddenly, and
all her wealth of hidden feeling quivered in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Geoff, Geoff! How sweet beyond words it is to
see you again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a second his arms were around her, and she was
strained to his breast with a force that was almost painful.
In silence he looked, eagerly and intently, deep into the
limpid brown eyes so near his own. Such ineffable tenderness
and devotion frankly answered his ardent, searching
gaze, that the force of his worship for this beautiful woman
grew not only unspeakable, but nigh too overwhelmingly
great to be borne. His brows contracted, and all unconsciously
he uttered a deep-breathed &quot;Oh!&quot; that bordered
on a groan of pain; then suddenly sinking on his
knees before her with the abandon of his artistic temperament,
he seized both her hands, covering them with kisses.
At last, pressing her soft palms hard against his cheeks, he
rested motionless, and scarcely could she hear his murmured
broken words&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How I adore you! I can scarcely endure it. You are
more perfect even than I remembered. Evarne! Evarne!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
She was already bending slightly forward, for unconsciously
he was dragging her hands downwards. She
leant lower, and lightly brushed his fair hair with her lips.
A divan was close by. She sank down, and, still kneeling,
Geoffrey rested his folded arms upon her knees and looked
up into her face.</p>

<p class="indent">The turmoil of strong emotion was still so far beyond
all possible expression, that to both speech could have
been merely a mockery. For a protracted period nothing
was said in spoken words. When Evarne finally broke the
long silence it was with tones so soft, so appealing, that
they were in themselves a gentle caress, although the actual
words were commonplace enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won&#39;t leave me again? You won&#39;t go away
any more?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not without you, my dearest, my dearest! Never
shall I go without you&mdash;no, not even to the end of the
street&mdash;if I can persuade you to come with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I would follow you willingly, whatever might
await us at the end of the street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really love me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You want to hear my voice tell you what you know
so well already?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff answered only with his eyes. Evarne put out both
hands and drew his head to her bosom, pressing it so tightly
that he felt the throbbing of her heart against his cheek.
After a minute the gentle whisper floated to his ears&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I loved you yesterday. I love you to-day, and I shall
love you to-morrow.&quot; After a little pause she added,
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you something more too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing else seems to matter. Still, do tell me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s just a little nothing. Only this&mdash;that I cared for
you before you ever cared for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, &#39;twas just contrariwise! It&#39;s no use to shake your
perverse darling head. I can prove it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean you can try.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
&quot;Now, listen. Remember that I saw you before you
ever saw me. You were reading the paper, but I was
reading your face. I had loved you for at least three full
minutes before you ever beheld me. How now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne laughed happily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you have won after all. Do you know, I like so
much to be told that your gaze was never coldly critical, or
even indifferent to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t imagine love that does not come at first sight,&quot;
declared Geoff with enthusiasm. &quot;Not in all its full
force and power, naturally, but at least as an immediate
conviction that here at length is the one who is to become
dearest in the whole world. Yet one hears of people knowing
each other for years before they learn to love. Isn&#39;t
that so? What sort of feelings do you suppose fill the
space of time between the first seeing and the first loving,
when the two are not almost simultaneous? Just interest
and liking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is no use looking questioningly at me,&quot; Evarne replied,
shaking her head gently. &quot;Besides, I thought men
had always had so much past experience in that direction
that they knew just everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff smiled at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you did, did you? I&#39;m afraid that branch of
my education has been shamefully neglected. And you&mdash;you
cannot teach me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t I, then? I know every whit as much concerning
love as did Diotima, who instructed Socrates in the art.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And who taught you, pray?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be jealous. I never had to learn; it&#39;s a natural
talent. Perhaps it was a gift from my fairy godmother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then it is all theory?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For half a minute Geoff did not speak. Painfully conscious
that she had now told him her first deliberate falsehood,
Evarne glanced into his thoughtful eyes with sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
apprehension. Then she hastened to break in upon this
silence, in which another such terrible question, incapable
of truthful answer, was perhaps being formulated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must have thought you cared for somebody before
you saw me, Geoff. Do tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. Now this is the solemn truth. Not only have
I never loved any other woman before you, but I&#39;ve never
even made the mistake of thinking a passing fancy was the
real thing. I&#39;ve never burned incense at the shrine of any
false goddess. In my heart I&#39;ve loved you all my life&mdash;that
is, the idea of you, Evarne. I&#39;ve worshipped you and
waited for you, sweetheart, and now, thank God, I&#39;ve found
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She answered very gently and slowly, her heart glowing
with triumph and delight at his avowal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it were possible, I should care for you even more
after hearing you say that. But how can I love you more
than to the very uttermost of my nature, and I believe I
have done that from the first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoffrey found this frank and unaffected confession more
adorable than any coquettish hesitation could have proved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But even if I had not been able to win your heart, I
should still have loved you always and ever, and held myself
your knight, ready to obey your slightest or your most
difficult command, my queen,&quot; he avowed with boyish
enthusiasm. &quot;I feel that it was preordained that I should
love you, and I should have readily fulfilled my fate, even
if you had never been able to care for me in return.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed and shook her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Geoffrey, do you love me indeed? Almost I doubt it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You doubt it? Evarne!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can&#39;t imagine what I mean? Sit by my side
and I&#39;ll explain.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Reclining delightfully in Geoff&#39;s arms, her slender arched
feet curled up on the couch, she expounded her startling
statement.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
&quot;When you say that it would not make any&mdash;well,
not much&mdash;difference in your feelings towards me if I did
not care for you in return, I wonder if you are not indulging
in a state of mind peculiar to poetic temperaments such as
yours, my dearest, and I feel jealous.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear child&mdash;jealous of whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cannot you guess? Why, of Love itself. I believe
you are so happy in having me to care for, simply because
you delight in loving. You are a worshipper of love in the
abstract; you fairly glory in that frame of mind people
call &#39;being in love.&#39; The possession of the emotion means
more to you than the possession of any particular woman.
There are some terrible people like that. They would
rather their mistress died than that she should destroy the
love she had awakened in their hearts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, fair Diotima, just please name one single individual
who ever felt that way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Easily! What about Dante, the patron saint of such
sinners? Do you suppose he could have had any ordinary
personal affection for his precious Beatrice? Why, he
only saw her twice, or something of that sort, and she was
respectably married to somebody else, yet she coloured his
whole life, and he seems to have been quite contented.
And he is never without disciples&mdash;a few. Oh, I know
you&mdash;people who are in love with Love itself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes? Go on telling me about them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Interested though he was in her slightest word, Geoffrey,
man-like, was not giving all his mind to Evarne&#39;s ideas.
He was enthralled by the contemplation of her sinuous,
supple form, her tenderly waving hair and satin-smooth
skin, and the live beams of her glancing eye; he was
glorying in the dulcet music of her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; she went on, feigning discontent, while her very
heart seemed pulsating in notes of perfect happiness&mdash;&quot;well,
you find some woman whom you can idealise and
adore, and if she be but passably gracious to you, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
proceed to make a world of happiness for yourselves merely
from loving her, dreaming of her, writing poems to her or
painting pictures that you think she has inspired&mdash;though
really it is nothing but your own capacity for loving that
she has made active that is the true source of your inspiration.
Even if you rarely see her it seems to make very
little difference&mdash;you still dream, still find inspirations,
still do great work under the divine influence of Aphrodite.
You live in the enchanted Palace of Love, and once safely
there, are horribly independent of the woman who opened
its magic portals to you. Oh, sorry fate that led me to
love an artist! So long as I condescend to exist and remain
tolerably young and beautiful, all is well. I cannot
possibly feel that your entire happiness depends upon my
presence or my absence, my smile or my frown. Now do
you see my grievance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t believe you know it, but you actually seem to
imply that you care for me more sincerely, more humanly,
than I do for you, which is obviously impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t see the &#39;obviousness.&#39; I should rather like
to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll soon tell you. You won&#39;t laugh at me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Laugh! Oh, my darling!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, the fact that it is you, your own dear self,
that I so glory in, and not any mere abstract mental
condition, is proved by this. I confess I always hoped the
time would come when I should be genuinely in love.
That&#39;s what you are not to laugh at, by the way! I knew
somehow that I had all the capacity for intense devotion,
and naturally enough, I suppose, longed to exercise it.
So if practically any young and attractive woman would
have served as the sort of figure-head you describe, should
I have been forced to wait&mdash;unwillingly enough, I can tell
you&mdash;until you, my only possible beloved, appeared upon
the scene? Of course not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had to wait for me&mdash;for me&mdash;for me!&quot; sang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
Evarne, keeping the time in her little song of triumph by
clapping her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is very wicked of you to be so pleased about it.
Why did you not come along earlier, my blessing? It is a
perfect misery, nothing else, to be empty-hearted. It is
terrible to feel a thousand emotions seeking desperately
for an outlet. Why did your star linger so long in crossing
mine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But no sympathy was to be extracted from Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has all been just as is best. You have been most
fortunate,&quot; she declared. &quot;Love is not the be-all and end-all
of any life, you know, and when you think of your chosen
work&mdash;which is the real thing&mdash;I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t regret
any emotional experiences, however distressing they may
have been in the learning. They are all needful training
for the production of soul-stirring pictures; as necessary,
in their way, as is the enchantment of loving and being
loved that is now going to help you still further. Mental
turmoil of every type bears its own special fruit that may
be garnered by an artist to his own advantage. Stagnation,
ignorance and lack of variety in emotions brings
ultimate failure in imaginative work. Thus speaks Diotima
the Second.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Far-away, curious echoes seemed ringing in Evarne&#39;s
brain. When and where and in what familiar voice had she
heard such sentiments spoken long, long ago?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it certainly is consoling to put all one&#39;s mental
worries into the same category as freehand drawing and
perspective,&quot; declared Geoff; and being both ardently
happy and therefore easily amused, they laughed merrily.</p>

<p class="indent">After a moment&#39;s pause he went on&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But don&#39;t you think the secret tragedy of many a
seemingly commonplace and prosaic person is the lack of
someone to be earnestly and devotedly adored? Don&#39;t
you think many and many a heart suffers from a craving
to exercise strong powers of loving forever ungratified?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
I&#39;m speaking of a spiritual demand&mdash;not of the universal
desire to find a mate that is just part of Nature&#39;s artful
little scheme for ensuring the due arrival of the next generation.
Do you think that demand of the spirit proves a
man merely a willing follower of Dante?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no no!&mdash;I suppose not. But, despite your specious
arguments, I still maintain that you, individually, are
one to rate love higher than any object. Obstinate, am I
not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Absolutely wicked, you dearest. I love you, my
Evarne&mdash;you yourself&mdash;in every possible way under the
sun, including the ordinary human love of any man, artist
or not, for the woman he seeks for his wife. There is perhaps
a tiny atom of truth in one of the charges you have
hurled at me, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I knew it, my dear commonplace lover. Confess, and
I&#39;ll see if I can forgive you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think, perhaps&mdash;dearest, I don&#39;t like even to speak of
it&mdash;but perhaps even your&mdash;I mean, if the world lost
you, my own beloved&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I died?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He flinched even at the words that expressed the possibility,
but went on&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That it would cause a more&mdash;how can I express my
meaning? Well, in one way, possibly, even that would
cause a less ever-present gap in my mental life than would
the destruction of my love for you.... It&#39;s no use
hitting me,&quot; he laughed; &quot;I can&#39;t help it, sweetest!&quot;
Then he clasped her closely with sudden eager passion.
&quot;But do not think that your dreamer is at all content to
worship only in spirit, Evarne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, impulsively, he poured forth a flood of words, ardent,
impassioned, throbbing with that fiery sex-love that dominates
the entire world&mdash;selfish, unheeding, remorseless&mdash;words
of that terrible overwhelming passion that will not
be long denied.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
&quot;That&#39;s how I want to be loved,&quot; she whispered, but
flung herself away from his grasp just in order to be drawn
close once more.</p>

<p class="indent">He seized her convulsively, held her in a cruelly fast grip,
covering her cheeks, her brow, her mouth with kisses,
violent and tender in turns. At last, pressing his face
against hers, he rested motionless. She felt the influence
of the contact spread itself slowly throughout her entire
frame, subtle and concentrated as electricity, and under its
power her breast heaved, and she breathed only in short
troubled gasps. The whole room, the whole world, seemed
to be throbbing, to be trembling&mdash;perhaps it was only the
arms that enfolded her that quivered&mdash;she neither knew
nor cared to know.</p>

<p class="indent">A deep silence held sway. The only moment&#39;s speech
was when Geoffrey murmured a sudden question about
their marriage, begging, imploring for an early date. It
should be quite soon, Evarne promised. It should be
within six weeks, five weeks, a month, less still, if he so
desired.</p>

<p class="indent">She had hesitated perceptibly before she answered.
This definite and verbal plighting of her troth was opposed&mdash;actively,
violently&mdash;for a few moments, by the resurrection
of those scruples she fancied had faded away once and for
all&mdash;false and misleading will-o&#39;-the-wisps of chivalrous
truth and honour, leading the unwise into bogs of wild
despair and utter misery. When at last she did speak it
was in a voice fraught with tremulous emotion, low, yet
inexpressibly thrilling&mdash;notes softer than the cooing of
wood-doves, and which reverberated upon the young
artist&#39;s highly-strung nerves with subtle emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">More than once Evarne had thought that his nature now
was not unlike what her own had been originally, before
three years of constant effort to please a jaded, middle-aged
man, added to unbroken association with coarse, depraved
minds, had sullied her soul, blunted her finer susceptibilities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
ruined her taste for the more delicate viands of
love&#39;s feast. Once upon a time she had sought with all her
strength to keep the affection that was offered her free from
all savour of passion; now, when devotion, as poetical,
refined and idealistic as imagination could devise had been
laid at her feet, she had felt starved, chilled, unsatisfied.</p>

<p class="indent">But as she looked into her dreamer&#39;s altered face and saw
its new expression, saw the grey eyes so strangely gleaming,
the slight occasional twitching of his lips, the distinct
though almost imperceptible veil of moisture that covered
his brow, she felt for a moment strangely degraded&mdash;curiously
identical with the early Christian Fathers&#39; estimate
of women. A moment&#39;s bitter regret of her own personality
cast its shadow. Geoff was too good for her. Ought
he not to love a young, innocent girl&mdash;one of those sweet
maidens who are to be found here and there even in this
grimy world, with thoughts white as snow-drifts, and
surely invisible halos around their meek downcast heads&mdash;pure
spirits that were scarcely conscious of possessing
bodies, and would assuredly never miss them? Ought
not one of these to have been Geoff&#39;s bright particular
star?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you certain you love me; that you&#39;re not deceiving
yourself?&quot; she asked again and again, and each time the
only response was a long kiss that penetrated to her heart&#39;s
core; a speaking, all-answering gaze; a closer, almost
frantic tightening of the arms in which she reclined.</p>

<p class="indent">And her moods changed as a kaleidoscope. Suddenly
she laughed aloud in triumphant satisfaction at herself,
all that she was, all that she could be. Of course Geoff
loved her, and he should love her yet more. Placid snow-maidens&mdash;you
must be content to shine in heaven; not
yours is it to make men thank God for life!</p>

<p class="indent">Now to the man who loved her Evarne appeared the very
acme of all perfection. And indeed, in that hour she verily
was all that is most appealing&mdash;most adorable&mdash;most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
exquisite. Her beauty was transcendent, and her expression
remained more noble, more respect-compelling than
she knew. And yet, all the while, her soft brown eyes,
whether swimming in happy, purposeless tears or shining
with inward fire, told, with more convincing eloquence than
lies within the power of speech, of the utter abandonment
of the soul they mirrored to the domination of the most
ardent and enthralling affection. She was all tenderness,
passion, charm, fascination. Her powerful magnetism
encircled her as an invisible cloud. Who, amid mortals,
coming within the radius of its influence, could have saved
himself from worshipping this fair woman to the very
uttermost limits of his capacity?</p>

<p class="indent">The stress of her own emotion was exhausting; a delicious
languor, a placid dreaminess, tinged with melancholy;
crept upon her. She felt incapable of further movement
or speech, and allowed her long-fringed lids to veil her eyes.
When she lifted them again it was to behold her lover&#39;s
gaze fixed upon her in a fresh access of passionate adoration
that could not be left unanswered. She smiled up at him,
a gentle little smile; it seemed serene and calm, but behind
it, like unto a powerful naked figure veiled in gauze, gleamed
love that was resolute, indomitable, heroic.</p>

<p class="indent">Her inarticulate little murmurs, her half-sighs, all her
tiny actions had been enchanting, enthralling; but her
smile&mdash;always sweet and moving&mdash;was now provocative
of ecstasy. Dazed, unconscious of his own personality,
again Geoff knelt before her, his arms clasped around her
waist, his face pressed against her soft body. Oblivious
to all of life save love alone, he bathed his spirit in this
inexhaustible fund of the gods&#39; best gift.</p>

<p class="indent">What said Evarne&#39;s most-admired philosopher?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say then of all in general, both men and women, that
the whole of our race would be happy if we worked out love
perfectly, and if each were to meet with his beloved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Was not Diotima, who taught Socrates, a wise woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
indeed, capable of imparting the truest, the most divine
of all wisdom?</p>

<p class="indent">Thus the winged hours sped past.</p>

<p class="indent">A dainty little supper was ready, and finally they sat
down side by side and played at eating. Over the little
meal the conversation became really quite practical and
business-like.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoffrey had said nothing of the prospect he had of succeeding
sooner or later to his childless cousin&#39;s earldom.
That startling piece of information seemed to him to be best
reserved for discussion on some other less idyllic occasion.
But it was partly this that gave emphasis to his inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You will not continue posing now, will you, dearie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not any choice,&quot; laughed Evarne. &quot;There are
some people who make me. Let me see, there&#39;s the landlord
and the tradesmen and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then come here, won&#39;t you? Really, I not only want
you&mdash;I need you. I&#39;m going to start a big picture&mdash;any
number of figures in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is the subject, and who am I to be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want you for Andromache. I&#39;m going to paint the
captured Trojan women.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall make a realistic captive, Geoff, being one in
very sooth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I verily believe I was inspired to paint such a subject
by the consciousness that I was free no longer, my captor.
I shall make a great thing of this picture, Evarne;
at least, I ought to. Everything will be in my favour.
Poor old Jack! He is still lamenting his unprocurable
model&mdash;his &#39;Belle Dame.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How different his work is from yours; poor old
Jack!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to try hard to persuade him to take up
portrait-painting definitely. He really is very clever, you
know. He ought to do well. Or sculpture; he&#39;s quite
strong at that. But he will insist on trying to be imaginative,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
and he doesn&#39;t shine there. Now, when is the earliest
day you can come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It so happens that I finish to-morrow with the man I&#39;m
sitting for at present. That&#39;s Thursday, the twentieth,
isn&#39;t it? Then I have nothing to do until Monday the
twenty-fourth, when I ought&mdash;it&#39;s all arranged&mdash;you see I
didn&#39;t expect you home until September!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A lot of engagements, have you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve only a few spare days here and there for the next
seven weeks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we&#39;re going to be married long before that time.
Look here, Evarne love, give them all up! Don&#39;t sit for
anyone else but me. Come, spoil me a bit. Let me be
selfish. My picture is all ready and waiting for the model.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s terribly unfair to the others, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind them. Seriously, I mean it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a shame, when they&#39;ve been waiting, but there&mdash;it&#39;s
delightful to be unkind to other people, and treat them
badly for your sake. It shall be as you wish. It is wrong,
though! Aren&#39;t you ashamed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A little later eleven o&#39;clock struck. Evarne pinned on
her hat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don&#39;t go yet! It&#39;s far too early,&quot; cried Geoffrey.</p>

<p class="indent">But Evarne only smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the contrary, it is rather late. Say good-bye
quickly,&quot; she responded.</p>

<p class="indent">The timepiece ticked on placidly, neither faster nor
slower than its usual steady wont.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness gracious, Geoff, you must send that silly
old clock to be mended. It actually has jumped a whole
quarter of an hour! It is no use its pretending we have
been twenty minutes saying good-bye. Do call a taxi
quickly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And to-morrow I&#39;m coming to supper with you. Oh
dear me! twenty-four hours to wait!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only about twenty now; and remember, if our stars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
in their courses had not chanced to touch, we might have
both lived twenty-four years more&mdash;and more still&mdash;and
been lonely to the end. See what we have escaped.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By midnight Evarne was safely alone in her own little
bedroom. She studied her reflection in the mirror before
removing her hat, and smiled with pleasure to behold cheeks
blooming as a blush rose; lips made up of happy curves;
and eyes shining for very joy as brightly as the most brilliant
stars in the summer heaven.</p>

<small>FRANK&#39;S BRILLIANT IDEA</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">On</span> Friday Evarne was free to give her time to Geoff,
and the big Greek picture was duly commenced.
Again she wore flowing white draperies, but of a
more ornate and ample description than the
very simple robe in which she had previously posed in this
studio. Her head was encircled by a barbaric fillet, studded
with roughly-cut, albeit gleaming stones, and high up on
her arms were wide bracelets of chased gold; for although
a captive, fair Andromache was a princess. Yet those same
arms bore delicate fetters around the wrists, for Hector&#39;s
widow was now a slave.</p>

<p class="indent">On her shoulder was to be borne a terra-cotta vase of
classical design. It was very beautiful, both in contour
and workmanship, but it was far from small, and Geoff was
troubled lest his dear model should grow weary.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must stop as soon as you even begin to feel tired;
don&#39;t wait for the ordinary rests. Will you promise?&quot;
he demanded, and smiling her assent, she took up the required
position.</p>

<p class="indent">The robe she wore was so fine in substance that where
the material actually touched her body it appeared to become
vaguely hued with the most delicate, the most tender
pink. On her arched feet were elaborate many-strapped
sandals; her classically beautiful head, inclined meekly
downwards, showed to perfection the gracious line at the
back of her neck. She was indeed sufficient to arouse and
inspire the most negligent of artists.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
But it so chanced that Frank Pallister had just received
an added impetus to his industry from another quarter.</p>

<p class="indent">A day or two before Geoff&#39;s unexpected return to England,
Frank had paid a solemn afternoon call on Mrs. Vandeleur.
This stately matron was Mr. Meridith&#39;s widowed
sister, who kept house for him and chaperoned pretty little
Maudie. She viewed Frank and his suit with a favourable
eye, yet approved her brother&#39;s decision with regard to
the postponed engagement. Thus, while a sense of duty
prompted her to hover around with considerable persistence,
it was often quite easy for the young people to make
opportunities for whispered flirtations.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, after duly listening to her complaints at being
still in sultry London when August was practically at hand,
from the necessity of Mr. Meridith&#39;s remaining in town
until Parliament rose, Maudie and Frank found opportunity
to exchange secret groans over the unendingness of three
years.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish to goodness I could shorten it!&quot; sighed the
youth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then why don&#39;t you?&quot; demanded the girl. &quot;You
know what dad says about it. Now, Frankie, why don&#39;t
you do something grand, superb, incomparable&mdash;something
that would cause the whole world to admire and wonder,
and make your name famous for ever and ever? I would,
if I were you, but you&#39;re a lazy boy, I know you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s easy to talk,&quot; was the rueful response. &quot;But you
just listen to what I&#39;ve got on hand. Some day soon,
Jack Hardy is to be allowed to do a marble bust of Lord
Winborough. I told you, didn&#39;t I? If the great man will
consent to be so far victimised, Jack is going to start proceedings
by taking a life-mask of him. Very well, then,
I&#39;m going to watch, and perhaps assist, and when I&#39;ve
learnt how to do it, I shall start and do a bust of somebody
or other who is well known. Then I have already got three
new pictures and two statuettes on hand. Some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
galleries are bound to take some of them when they&#39;re
finished, I should suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Frankie,&quot; was the answer given in all seriousness,
&quot;I am so terribly afraid you&#39;re a genius!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afraid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, for then you&#39;ll never get on in the world. It is
only the second-rate people who reach the top of the ladder;
the real born geniuses stick on the bottom rung, just because
their work is too superior to be understood and appreciated
by the common mob. There! What do you
think of that? Dreadful, isn&#39;t it, poor boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid you needn&#39;t upset yourself over my misfortunes
in that direction. Who told you all this piffle?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody exactly. I overheard two men talking at an
&#39;at home.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were they neglected geniuses?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know. I asked dad what they did, and he said
he believed that one composed poetry and that the other
wrote tragedies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like Frank to see Sir James&#39;s painting
of you?&quot; interposed the voice of Mrs. Vandeleur.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl sprang to her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fancy my forgetting! It&#39;s finished at last. It&#39;s in
the dining-room at present. Come along. But don&#39;t
expect much. It&#39;s not a bit nice; it&#39;s really ugly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And indeed, on beholding the celebrated portrait-painter&#39;s
production, Frank&#39;s loud exclamations of surprise
and disdain were as profuse as the most disappointed of
sitters could desire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t your dad annoyed?&quot; he demanded at length.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, he&#39;s really vexed. He is paying so highly for
it too. You remember the one of my mother that hangs in
his study? That was done when she was seventeen, and he
thought it would be so nice to have a companion one of his
only kiddie at the same age. He wouldn&#39;t have minded the
big price in the least if the picture had been satisfactory.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
This has been altered ever so many times, and now Sir
James has got tired, and swears it is exactly like me; but
it isn&#39;t, is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old boy must be getting in his dotage. Now, I
could paint you just beautifully, I&#39;m sure. You would be
such a jolly subject. I say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pallister glanced round to make sure that Mrs. Vandeleur
was safely out of earshot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think your dad would consent to our engagement
without any delay if I made a perfectly lovely
picture of you? He would have to believe there was
something in me then, wouldn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Frankie, what a perfectly fine idea. I dare say he
would. Let&#39;s ask him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the originator of the idea, with a frown of thought
upon his brow, shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To really have the proper effect it ought to be sprung
upon him as a complete surprise&mdash;quite finished. &#39;Splendid!
magnificent! superb!&#39; he will exclaim, when he sees
it&mdash;at least, I hope that&#39;s what he will say! Then he will
go on: &#39;Only tell me what artist has produced this masterpiece.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then you&#39;ll answer&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing. I shan&#39;t speak a word&mdash;not a word! I
shall just quietly and modestly point to my name in the
corner. Oh, isn&#39;t it just a ripping plan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lovely! Perfectly delightful!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you&#39;ll have to come sometimes to Geoff Danvers&#39;s
studio and give me sittings, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then auntie is to be in the secret?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be a secret for long if she knew. No,
you must come alone. Do! It will be quite all right&mdash;really
it will. Jack is always there, and we almost always
have a woman model, so there would be a sort of a chaperone.
You&#39;ll come? Remember what depends on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
&quot;It is awfully venturesome, but I&#39;ll do it,&quot; promised
the girl after a moment&#39;s hesitation.</p>

<p class="indent">At this point Mrs. Vandeleur approached, and the remaining
details of the conspiracy had to be hastily whispered
at parting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll come as often as you can, duckie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but I shan&#39;t be able to let you know long beforehand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll get the canvas ready at once. Come to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t. I&#39;ll let you know when. What shall I wear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any white frock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll remember. Good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This arrangement had been entered into over a week ago,
and as yet no word had come from Maudie. Nevertheless
Pallister was working away with renewed ardour, living in a
state of eager expectation. Of course, the little idea had
to be confided to Geoff, since he had so unexpectedly reappeared
upon the scene. Strangely enough, it did not
appeal to him in the light of an unquestionably brilliant
notion preordained to success. He was inclined to advise
decidedly against it, but finding that his opinion, although
formally asked, was in reality not wanted in the least, he
raised no actual objection to the carrying out of the plan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Geoff,&quot; persisted the somewhat crushed Pallister,
&quot;surely it is an awfully fine idea, so enterprising and original.
Don&#39;t you think so really?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve told you I fancy it&#39;s quite as likely to vex Mr.
Meridith as to please him; but of course I may be mistaken.
Who can tell what will melt a stern father&#39;s stony
heart? You know him much better than I do, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s awfully good of you, old chap, not to mind.
I hope it won&#39;t interfere with your work too much. You
know, I rather feel I ought to clear out at once, now you&#39;ve
come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a bit of it. Stop at least until Miss Meridith&#39;s
portrait is done. You couldn&#39;t ask her to go to any strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
studio, you know. It&#39;s quite different here, where her
father knows the whole lot of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So much for Frank&#39;s enterprise.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack Hardy also was working with increased ardour, with
renewed interest and hope.</p>

<p class="indent">On the afternoon of the very day of his return from
Venice, Geoff had called at the Albany to make inquiries
regarding Lord Winborough&#39;s whereabouts. However
far afield his cousin might happen to be, he almost invariably
returned to England in the late summer and
paid frequent visits to London.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff was anxious to persuade Lord Winborough now
definitely to arrange to fulfil his promise of sitting to Jack
Hardy. It had not taken Geoff long to discover that his
friend was unhappy and dispirited. The allegorical
picture had been so far a miserable failure, and had left
Jack in exactly the frame of mind to follow the dictates
of worldly wisdom. He knew in his heart that portraiture,
whether in oils or marble, was his <i>forte</i>, and the news that
Lord Winborough was expected at his chambers in the
course of a few days had served to brace him up anew. He
would follow up the advantages in obtaining paying &quot;sitters&quot;
that would probably result from his exhibiting a
successful bust of the earl, and the long-dreamed-of &quot;Belle
Dame&quot; picture should really be the last of its type, as far
as he was concerned. Having definitely made up his mind
to this, he was rewarded by a renewal of enthusiasm and
belief in the future.</p>

<p class="indent">Saturday was devoted to work, but Geoff and Evarne
spent the whole of Sunday up the river. To both it was a
time of unmitigated delight. Sunshine, fair placid scenery,
youth, health and love&mdash;what could have been added to
render the hours more idyllic, golden, divine? If Evarne
knew much sorrow, she had, as if in recompense, an intimate
acquaintance with a far deeper, a more intense happiness
than ever falls within the lot of many. She and Geoff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
agreed that next Sunday should be passed in the same
manner. Quite definitely this was decided&mdash;&quot;unless it
rained!&quot; That was the only possible obstacle that presented
itself. Ah well! the mere decision was pleasant,
and served to soften the hour of parting.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXXIII" id="chXXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />
<small>THE SHADOW OF COMING EVENTS</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Monday</span> morning dawned. Evarne looked more
radiantly lovely than ever after her day in the
open air, and work was re-attacked with
general ardour. The only interruption to
the proceedings was a ring at the door, which came as
lunch-time was approaching. It proved to be a man with
a letter for Geoff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is rather interesting to us all!&quot; he exclaimed as
he read it. &quot;Winborough arrived in London on Saturday.
I left a note for him, you know, Jack, and he says he will
come at three o&#39;clock on Wednesday to be &#39;life-masked,&#39;
but he is coming in here this afternoon just to see us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack flushed with sudden excitement and apprehension.
Geoff laid down the letter and looked at Evarne. These
few days of their engagement left her still ignorant of his
position and relationship towards Winborough. Geoff
could hardly have given any reason for his reticence&mdash;there
could, indeed, be no rational explanation forthcoming&mdash;it
was just a purposeless fancy that had not mattered
hitherto. But now she must know. She always lunched
with him in his sitting-room, while Jack and Pallister
sought their mid-day repast out of doors. He would tell
her then; and Lord Winborough himself must no longer
be kept in ignorance of his heir&#39;s forthcoming marriage.
There seemed to be an ample dose of &quot;tellings&quot; before
Geoffrey that day.</p>

<p class="indent">But Pallister all unconsciously relieved him of one.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
&quot;I&#39;m really awfully excited,&quot; he declared. &quot;I&#39;ve never
seen his lordship, but Mr. Meridith knows him quite well.
Maudie calls him a &#39;dear.&#39; And I&#39;m awfully thrilled, too,
at the prospect of taking a life-mask. I shall be longing
to try when once I&#39;ve seen it done. Will you let me practise
on you, Miss Stornway?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s rather terrible, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t think so. Only a bit unpleasant. Nothing to
hurt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you done many, Mr. Hardy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Several. It&#39;s a wonderful help towards getting a likeness,
especially if the sitter&#39;s time is precious. Still, it
is uncommonly hateful to go through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t tell Lord Winborough that! How do you
start?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you rub cold-cream or some such decoction well
into the skin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the sake of the victim&#39;s complexion, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Partly. Next you put a couple of quills into his
nostrils.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To breathe through?&quot; chipped in Pallister.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Precisely; and very careful you have to be, I can tell
you, considering that it&#39;s the one and only way in which a
supply of fresh air can be obtained, for the next step is to
pour moist plaster all over the face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How clammy! Much of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at first&mdash;only a thin layer; but after you&#39;ve laid
a piece of string downways on either cheek, you add more
plaster until it&#39;s about an inch thick. There it has to
remain until it hardens. Then you draw up the two
strings, thereby cutting the mask into three parts, and
take it off, a firm and absolute replica of the features.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it does sound rather dangerous,&quot; declared Evarne
after a moment&#39;s thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not with ordinary care and attention. It&#39;s quite
safe,&quot; Jack assured her; &quot;but it feels much worse than it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
is really. One&#39;s whole life undoubtedly depends on those
two breathing-quills. I went through it once myself, and
I couldn&#39;t help thinking of what would happen if by any
accident they got choked up. The operator always keeps
a pair of scissors handy to snip off the end in case by any
chance a splash of plaster happens to settle on it. Still, it
needs a deal of nerve, I must confess. You can&#39;t hear a
sound except an indistinct sort of rumbling and the thud
of your own heart like a sledge-hammer. I should think
it&#39;s a bit like being buried alive. I tried to lift an eyelid,
but the plaster held it in an immovable grip, and of
course your lips are so sealed that it is impossible to speak
a single word. I assure you, it did make me feel queer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder,&quot; inquired Pallister meditatively, &quot;what
would happen if you just <i>had</i> to sneeze?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Jack declined to venture an opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t promise to be done,&quot; Evarne declared
with some degree of emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, would you expect anybody to consent after that
lurid description, Jack?&quot; inquired Geoff, laughing. &quot;It&#39;s
a good thing Winborough can&#39;t hear your vivid reminiscences,
or he would suddenly recall some other imperative
engagement for Wednesday afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps he won&#39;t come anyhow,&quot; suggested Pallister,
bent on teasing. &quot;You should just have heard a Socialist
gentleman&mdash;one of your pet pals, I dare say, Jack&mdash;who
was addressing an attentive and admiring audience in
Hyde Park yesterday. &#39;These bloated haristiscrats, pampered
from their cots upwards,&#39; he declared, were, without
exception, fickle and false and altogether unreliable, and
&#39;ought to be wiped off the face of the globe altogether!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Lord Winborough hasn&#39;t been &#39;pampered from
his cot upwards,&#39;&quot; returned Jack unperturbed. &quot;He only
came into the title about five years ago, so you see he is
scarcely one of those whom &#39;my pet pal, the Socialist,&#39;
was referring to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
Pallister ceased grinning at his own wit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, of course, I know. He will keep his promise right
enough,&quot; he said seriously. Then, suddenly recollecting
himself: &quot;I say, Geoff, I didn&#39;t mean to be personal. If
your cousin goes and dies without children, we don&#39;t expect
you to alter, and be fickle and false and all the rest of it,
just because you become Earl of Winborough, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne&#39;s lips parted, and, turning her head, she gazed
at Geoff with eyes filled with utter amazement and incredulity.
That young man threw down his brushes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here,&quot; he said lightly, &quot;it&#39;s a quarter to one.
I think we had better stop work and have lunch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right you are,&quot; cried Pallister the lazy. &quot;Come along,
Jackie, my boy; we had better take plenty of time to
strengthen ourselves for this afternoon. We have both
got to make a good impression, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack partly understood Geoff&#39;s evident anxiety to get
them gone. He promptly pulled off his painting overall
and put on his coat. Pallister, with no such change of
costume to effect, was already awaiting him, and in a very
few minutes they were both out of the place.</p>

<p class="indent">Already Geoff had freed Evarne from her golden fetters.
They fastened by means of snaps, and it needed the use of
both hands to open them. The long connecting chain was
quite unbreakable, though charmingly light and delicate
in workmanship. He occupied the time while his friends
were dressing in subjecting it to a series of vigorous little
tugs, as if to test its strength; but directly the studio door
had closed, he cast it aside and turned to Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely I didn&#39;t understand rightly?&quot; she queried, in
tones of ill-suppressed anxiety. &quot;I thought Mr. Pallister
seemed to say that Lord Winborough was not only your
cousin, but that you were his heir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff acknowledged this to be verily the truth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t mention it long ago,&quot;
he continued apologetically. &quot;It&#39;s very silly of me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
appear to have made any sort of a mystery about it, for
naturally it&#39;s no secret. It can&#39;t be exactly termed a misfortune
in itself, can it, while of course it does not make the
slightest little bit of difference in our feelings for one
another?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not so sure,&quot; rejoined Evarne sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">With slow steps she walked across the room and sat down
by the open window, gazing out into vacancy with troubled
eyes. She felt no pleasurable excitement, no eager interest,
in this marvellous piece of news. On the contrary, the
fact that her lover held a position of so much greater importance
in the estimation of the world than she had for one
moment suspected, appeared to her simply and solely as
an unqualified misfortune. Viewed in the light of this new
discovery, his marriage with a woman who was, after all,
only an artist&#39;s model, and, moreover, one weighed down by
a secret that a very few inquiries on the part of the curious
might reveal, became a matter of entirely different import.
Such ominous forebodings, such fresh doubts and apprehensions
crowded upon her, that tears burned under her
eyelids, while an expression of utter misery settled upon
her features.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoffrey sped over to her side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My own dearest darling, please, please don&#39;t look so
worried about it. I&#39;m so sorry I didn&#39;t tell you at once,
but left you to find out so suddenly. I was an idiot. If
you look like that, I shall never forgive myself. Why does
it make you unhappy? I should have thought you&#39;d be
rather pleased, if anything. What a sigh! After all,
it&#39;s not so wonderfully important. It will not make the
least bit of difference to us for years and years to come&mdash;perhaps
never&mdash;who can tell?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne did not answer. The longer she reflected the
more overwhelming appeared this unforeseen complication.
Of course, as soon as her engagement became common
knowledge, all sorts of people would want to learn all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
about her; the events of her whole past life would probably
be delved into&mdash;and then&mdash;what? She wished Geoffrey
would leave her alone for a time. She wanted to think.</p>

<p class="indent">But the more anxious and depressed she appeared, the
more concerned and self-reproachful he grew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not vexed with you personally, dear,&quot; she was at
length compelled to explain. &quot;You mustn&#39;t think that
for a moment. Only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Only what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was thinking of a part of Mrs. Browning&#39;s translation
of &#39;Prometheus Bound.&#39; Do you remember it?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Oh, wise was he, oh, wise was he,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Who first within his spirit knew,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And with his tongue proclaimed it true,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That love comes best that comes unto</span><br />
<span class="i0">The equal of degree!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And that the poor and that the low</span><br />
<span class="i0">Should seek no love from those above....&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">She broke off suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Geoffrey, that is true! I know it is, and it does
seem so suited to us now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I noticed you discreetly ceased before reaching the last
lines, which would make the application I suppose you intend
far from complimentary to me, Mistress Evarne. My
soul is neither &#39;proud&#39; nor &#39;fluttered by rows of ancestral
lights,&#39; or anything of that sort. Nothing &#39;flutters&#39; it
except your sweet self, so that verse does not suit at all.
How dare you shake your head? Don&#39;t you believe me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes! I do, of course. But there is your cousin
to consider. I shall never gain his goodwill. He will
never give his consent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our marriage will be legal without that, my own
dearest. But really,&quot; and Geoff came out boldly with a
thundering big lie, &quot;really I don&#39;t anticipate his raising
any serious objection. You see, it would be too absurd,
considering that it&#39;s the merest chance that he has got any
title at all. When the old earl and his brother, and both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
his sons and his little grandson all died within three years,
it was necessary to go back over a century&mdash;if you ever
heard of such a thing&mdash;before they came to the point at
which the line from which we are descended branched off.
Why, for my part, I scarcely realised we were related to the
family at all. We didn&#39;t even know the old earl personally.
It would be too absurd of us to put on airs and
graces as if we were superior sort of creatures born to wear
strawberry-leaves. It&#39;s just simply the merest chance.
Now, after that long explanation don&#39;t let&#39;s talk about it
any more, since it worries you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must say one thing. We have never spoken at all yet
about money or position, or anything of that sort, have we?
Still, I have known all along, and you also must have known
full well, that in choosing me you were marrying in every
respect far below yourself and what your people would
deem&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; broke in Geoff, &quot;please, please don&#39;t talk in that
manner. It isn&#39;t generous of you, Evarne. It isn&#39;t like
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must finish, though. You are proposing to marry
far below what your relations would consider seemly in any
case, and most undeniably you have not made a fitting
choice when one remembers what the future probably
holds for you. You don&#39;t see things quite as other people
do, you know; but I am more worldly-minded and practical.
I think&mdash;I do really&mdash;that this engagement between us is
scarcely suitable, and that it ought not to exist.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff placed his hands heavily on her shoulders with a
somewhat frantic grip, and looked at her in serious alarm
for a moment. Then he spoke with forced carelessness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you really think to persuade me of your claim to
be considered &#39;worldly-minded&#39; by trying now to get me to
give you up, do you&mdash;you darling? Listen to me. I shall
marry you or nobody! If you won&#39;t have me, I shall go
down to my grave a morose, disagreeable old bachelor.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
I shall always be doing my level best to make all around me
utterly miserable, and although everyone will fear and hate
me, a few discerning folk will explain, &#39;Oh, don&#39;t you
know? That poor old man was crossed in love in the days
of his youth, and has never got over it!&#39; Would you like
to have that on your conscience, Evarne mine? Now,
come in to lunch, and we won&#39;t speak another word of
cousins or earls or prospects or anything of the sort. We
will just talk about ourselves. We are by far the most
interesting topic in the world, aren&#39;t we, darling?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He caught her hand and commenced to draw her across
the room. He looked so young, so happy, so full of life,
that Evarne forcibly thrust all her own miseries back into
the depth of her heart. She could not endure to see the
glad look fade from his eyes even for a minute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, Geoff,&quot; she said in all meekness. &quot;As
long as you are sure that you really want me, I will never
leave you of my own accord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a promise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, it shall be. But remember this, if you do
come to believe that perhaps you would do wisely to listen
to what I feel convinced your cousin&#39;s advice will be, you
must not hesitate or think of me at all. I only exist now
to please you, and I&#39;m not afraid of spoiling you by telling
you so, dear. My first and only wish is that everything
shall be well with your life. Remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He bent his head and kissed the hand he held, but declined
to even discuss this subject with any seriousness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; he said lightly. &quot;I&#39;m starving hungry! More
than anything else in the world at the present moment I
want you to give me my lunch.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXIV" id="chXXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />
<small>SEKHET WHETS HER TEETH</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">No</span> one felt able thoroughly to settle themselves
steadily to work that afternoon, for Lord Winborough
had not timed his visit, and might be
expected at any moment.</p>

<p class="indent">They laughed and chatted for some time, but gradually
painting was beginning to engross somewhat of its
usual meed of attention, when the electric bell rang
out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be Winborough,&quot; declared Geoff as he left
the room immediately to admit his visitor.</p>

<p class="indent">The studio door swung to, so that only a confused murmur
of voices came from the hall. In a minute it was
opened again, and Geoff was heard saying&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh yes, we&#39;re all much the same as usual. You remember
Jack Hardy, and this is Frank Pallister.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was standing with her back towards the door,
and as the two young men had at once crossed over in that
direction, they had passed out of the range of her vision;
for, despite these interruptions, with the instincts of a
thoroughly good model she had not stirred unbidden from
her pose.</p>

<p class="indent">She heard Jack make a brief speech in his most polite
style, though obviously with considerable nervousness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to thank you, Lord Winborough, for so kindly
consenting to spare some of your time to sit for me. I
know how busy you are, and am more than grateful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The answer came in smooth, even tones.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
&quot;Indeed, Mr. Hardy, it is a pleasure to be able to assist
in any degree so talented and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the sound of this voice an icy hand seemed to lay
itself upon Evarne&#39;s heart, chilling her blood. With
parted lips and eyes staring with terror she turned round.
There, in the centre of the little group, stood&mdash;Morris
Kenyon!</p>

<p class="indent">Well may the rapidity of thought be employed as a
synonym for the uttermost conception of speed. Simultaneously
with the tremendous mental shock of beholding
this man again under such horrible, such undreamed-of
circumstances&mdash;above the resultant seeming cessation of
all the wheels of life within her body, the sudden uncontrollable
shivering that shook her from head to foot&mdash;she
became conscious that her brain was frantically urging her
to instantly do something by which to account for this
physical agitation&mdash;something to explain this uncontrollable
display of emotion. It prompted the method.
She followed it without a second&#39;s hesitation. Before any
of the men had turned their gaze upon her, she had deliberately
let go of the vase she carried. It fell heavily, and was
smashed into a dozen pieces.</p>

<p class="indent">Down on her knees she sank, bending her head low, as,
with trembling hands, she gathered together the nearest
fragments. Her actions were quite instinctive; her whole
mind was bent on the recovery of her self-control. And
she succeeded. When, after a minute&#39;s respite, she did
dare lift her face, it was marked by no traces of greater
concern than could easily be accounted for as the result of
this embarrassing accident.</p>

<p class="indent">If Morris Kenyon, seeing her again with equal unexpectedness,
had been guilty of any dramatic start or exclamation,
it had passed quite unnoticed. All attention
was turned upon Evarne, and Geoff was already by her
side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, what is the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
She would not meet his eyes; her own might be too full
of emotion. She sought to speak, but no words came.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff grew alarmed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you feeling ill? Can I do anything? Never
mind those silly broken pieces. Tell me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She made a tremendous effort. She could&mdash;she should&mdash;answer
him rationally and calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m frightened, Geoff,&quot; she whispered quickly and very
softly&mdash;&quot;after what I learnt this morning. You understand?
His voice sounded so hard, and he looks so stern.
I was frightened.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put his hand over hers and pressed it sympathetically,
but no more could be said in confidence. The
three other men had approached.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s happened, Miss Stornway?&quot; inquired Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff explained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s tired, that&#39;s all. She ought to have rested long ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne spoke for herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m so dreadfully grieved to have broken this beautiful
vase. I can&#39;t think how I came to drop it. Oh, I am so
sorry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter the least bit,&quot; Geoff declared emphatically.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was now seated on the edge of the throne, and
for a minute the four men stood in a semicircle, silently
surveying her. She could have wrung her hands in agony
under this scrutiny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please don&#39;t bother about me any longer,&quot; she cried,
and there were traces of rising excitement in her voice.
&quot;I am so sorry to have made such a stupid disturbance.
Please, please leave me alone now. There&#39;s nothing the
matter with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff took her at her word.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come over here and look at the beginning of my new
picture, Winborough,&quot; he suggested, after a final keen and
anxious glance at Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
While the scarcely-started canvas was being explained,
and attention was thus entirely distracted from herself,
Evarne brought all the force of her will to bear on gaining
complete self-mastery. And for this she had need to call
upon that emergency fund of strength, endurance and
resolution that a woman&#39;s fine nervous system almost invariably
produces when great necessity demands. Every
moment the horror that assailed her appeared to grow more
crushing, more unendurable, yet she sat there silent and
motionless, with an unruffled brow and an expression of
perfect calm upon her beautiful features.</p>

<p class="indent">She could not keep her fascinated gaze from the spectacle
of the two cousins going the round of the room together,
Geoff chatting gaily as he displayed the various
little oddments and curiosities that he had brought from
Italy. Finally he produced a portfolio of water-colour
sketches and handed them to his cousin one by one, describing,
explaining, pointing out various parts that were
to be especially noticed. Morris nodded, questioned,
admired, held them at arm&#39;s-length to be better judged,
all apparently without another thought in his mind beyond
Art and Venice.</p>

<p class="indent">As the two men stood thus side by side, Evarne could
most distinctly see traces of the relationship between them&mdash;more
in the demeanour, the general build and outline,
than in feature&mdash;but kinship, clear and unmistakable.
There was exactly the same carriage of the head, much the
same walk, while their hands&mdash;slender, long-fingered and
especially well-tended&mdash;were practically identical.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris had changed very little in the seven years that
had been lived through since the stormy scene that had
marked that final parting on that spring morning in Paris.
His dark hair was thinner, perchance, and turning grey
upon the temples; there were a few more of Time&#39;s
scratches upon his brow. But although he must be now
somewhere about fifty-five, his figure&mdash;thanks probably to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
his devotion to fencing&mdash;was still as slender, as trim and
upright as that of any of the younger men in the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne had opportunity of studying his appearance at
leisure, for not once did he glance in her direction. She
knew this must be intentional, and was so far grateful,
though such a mild emotion could find scant place in her
mind just then. It was almost unendurable to see those
two men standing side by side thus. Not only was the
instinct of self-preservation on the alert, but every refined
impulse in her nature was outraged by the spectacle. Unconsciously
she caught hold of the slightly overlapping
edge of the floor of the throne, and dragged at it with such
unsparing force that the muscles of her arms stood up terse
and hard.</p>

<p class="indent">The sketches all surveyed, the conversation turned on
Jack, his work and the bust that was to be undertaken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve just finished a life-size statue of a child,&quot; Jack
said. &quot;It&#39;s only in clay at present, but I am going to
work it out in marble&mdash;perhaps as a memorial-stone. You
think it is good, don&#39;t you, Geoff?&quot; and he turned
anxiously towards his friend for confirmation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed it is splendid,&quot; was the ready answer &quot;You
should see it, Winborough. It is in the plaster-room
yonder. It is a dreadful weight to lift. Will you go in
there and look at it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Winborough cordially assented, and escorted by Jack
and Pallister he left the studio.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff did not accompany the trio. He was anxious
about Evarne, and, sitting down beside her, he slipped his
arm around her waist as he declared in a tone of raillery&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sweetheart, you have surprised me! I had no
idea you were such a little coward. I thought you were
as brave as anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She hastened to account for this sudden weakness by
numerous excuses. It seemed to her that it must necessarily
have aroused some suspicion, although Geoff&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
manner showed not the slightest trace of any such
feeling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t like you to think me cowardly,&quot; she said, &quot;so
please remember all I have had lately to upset me. First
of all, I have not really been feeling fit to pose lately. I&#39;m
weary! The engagement I finished on Thursday was a
terribly trying one. I stood for that wretched artist for
the figure for nearly six weeks without missing a single
day except Sundays. He wanted to get his picture done
before he went away for his holidays, and he succeeded,
but it made me quite ill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff was properly indignant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was enough to kill you; you should not consent to do
such things. You must not play with your health like that.
You ought never to have sat at all for such a selfish brute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, you don&#39;t know what it is to have to earn your
own living,&quot; she declared with a little smile. &quot;I certainly
did intend resting for the remainder of the week, but you
were so anxious to start your picture, dear, that I went
right on without even a day&#39;s interval.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now Geoff was indeed repentant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my darling, I didn&#39;t understand! I didn&#39;t know!
It&#39;s all my fault. How horribly thoughtless I am! Why
didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t think it would matter. I am very strong, you
know, as a rule. But what I learnt this morning so suddenly
worried me seriously; and then&mdash;I told you&mdash;I got
so frightened when your cousin was really here, that my
silly hands trembled, and I broke that vase that I know
you value. So altogether, if I was a bit pale and not quite
myself, it wasn&#39;t without sufficient cause, was it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even as she spoke she found herself wondering why she
took this trouble to blind Geoffrey&#39;s eyes. If he did not
immediately learn the true reason of her alarm at the sight
of his cousin, he would know to-morrow&mdash;or the day after&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
the day after that! It could be only a question of a
more or less brief time. Why not give up the struggle at
once? Her heart ached as she listened to his expressions
of self-reproach, knowing as she did that he had been unfailingly
kind and considerate towards her from the hour
of their first meeting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evarne, dearest, do forgive me. You have made me
feel terribly remorseful. One thing after another for you
to endure, and all my fault! If that is the best care I
can take of you, I don&#39;t deserve to have you, that&#39;s certain.
Dear, say you forgive me this time. I will try and be more
thoughtful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He drew her closer to his side, and right gladly would
she have rested there and endeavoured to forget the world,
its deceptions and its difficulties. But this was most decidedly
not the time for such indulgence, and she was in
the very act of withdrawing herself from his encircling arm,
when exactly that which she was seeking to avoid came to
pass. Jack must needs choose this psychological moment
to throw open the door and conduct Winborough back
into the studio.</p>

<p class="indent">It was an awkward moment for everyone. Geoff rose
to his feet, but did not loosen his arm from around Evarne.
It merely slipped upwards from her waist to her shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack looked absolutely aghast. Pallister gave vent to
a silly inopportune little snigger, while Winborough demanded
somewhat sarcastically&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you spend much of your time studying art by such
methods, Geoffrey, my boy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me explain,&quot; said the young man without a
moment&#39;s hesitation. &quot;It may come as a complete surprise
to you, Winborough; but Jack, and even Pallister,
who have been here with us in the studio, must be fully
prepared to hear of my good fortune. I mean that I have
asked Miss Stornway to become my wife, and she has
consented.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
That even under these difficult circumstances Geoffrey
would make this startling announcement publicly, on the
spot, without either warning or preparation, was as unlooked-for
by Evarne as it could have been by any of the
others. But the emergency did not find her wanting.
With this new demand came fresh strength. Instantly
rising to her feet, she drew herself up to her full height,
lifted her head proudly, and without the slightest trace of
fear or faltering, advanced a couple of steps forward.
Then, by sheer force of will she compelled Morris Kenyon
to meet her eye, and resolutely concentrated the whole of
her mental strength to its uttermost limits in sending forth
a wordless message&mdash;a command&mdash;that this man should
not speak to betray her.</p>

<p class="indent">And silence prevailed in the room!</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne remained motionless, her soft robes falling around
her in gracious dignified folds, her beautiful head haughtily
upraised. She made herself, by mere force of character
and dauntless determination, absolute mistress of the situation
for the time being.</p>

<p class="indent">But the fetters were still around her wrists!</p>

<p class="indent">The silence was finally broken by Geoffrey. Turning
from the cousin with whom he had but little in common,
he looked across at his chosen friend, and asked somewhat
coldly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Jack, have you nothing to say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus adjured, that young man pulled himself together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Geoff, I&mdash;I really&mdash;I do congratulate you&mdash;both
of you. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve completely floored me,&quot; cried Pallister gaily,
recovering his breath. &quot;I&#39;m so surprised, you can come
and knock me down with a feather if you want to. I&#39;m
sure I congratulate you heartily. Three cheers for Mr.
and Mrs. Danvers! Hurrah! Can I be best man?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Evarne scarcely heard anything of this. She and
Morris still stood separated by the length of half the room,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
gazing sternly into one another&#39;s eyes, each reading and
sending forth defiance, antagonism, mutual hatred.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet when Winborough at length spoke it was in tones
that were quite light and casual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If marriage wasn&#39;t such a confounded knot to untie,
there would not be the same need for careful consideration
beforehand that undoubtedly there is now&mdash;more&#39;s the
pity! When you do marry, Geoff, I wish you every happiness&mdash;that
you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne returned to the throne and sat down again.
Having averted the danger of Morris speaking out on impulse
at first hearing Geoff&#39;s announcement, she felt herself
safe for the minute. He would indeed be strangely altered
if he now suddenly burst forth into accusations, making a
scene in the presence of Jack and Pallister, and running
the risk of ensuring public talk and scandal. Besides, she
still retained sufficient faith in his honour to believe that
he would not deliberately give away her secret to men
whom it did not concern.</p>

<p class="indent">But before long her apprehensions were again up in
arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are inhospitable here,&quot; announced his lordship.
&quot;Do artistic aspirations do away with parched throats,
even on sultry July afternoons? If so, that&#39;s rather an
important point for temperance advocates. For my part,
fancying I remember where you keep your whisky and
syphons, Geoff, I&#39;m going to see if I can look after myself,
eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With the utmost nonchalance he strolled out of the
studio. As Winborough had anticipated, Geoffrey promptly
followed him.</p>

<p class="indent">As soon as they were alone in the sitting-room, Winborough
rounded on the young man sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look here, what folly is this? Is it possible you are
really thinking of marrying that girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you so plainly enough, didn&#39;t I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
&quot;Preposterous! Do you suppose you can be allowed
to take up seriously with any stray creature who happens
to please your fancy? The idea is absurd&mdash;utterly
absurd!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff&#39;s eyes flashed, but he kept his temper. He had
fully anticipated that Winborough would at first oppose
this marriage. But of course all objections were founded
on mere prejudice and ignorance, so he answered quietly
in the hope of explaining and thus conciliating his cousin.
He tried to express the admiration, the respect and the
affection he felt for Evarne, in a manner totally devoid of
any exaggeration or seeming blindness, but with unmistakable
clearness and certainty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are prejudiced against Evarne because of her
profession, Winborough; but when you have known her
for a little while you will be forced to acknowledge that,
despite it, she is in every respect as near perfection as any
human being can possibly be. In culture and refinement,
in mind and manner, she is the equal of my own mother.
She is absolutely honourable and straightforward and high-principled,
and I love her. Now, I ask you, what more
can one want? If she is a bit below me socially, that is
the one and only drawback&mdash;such as it is&mdash;that anyone
can possibly adduce; and after all, it is her personality
and my feelings that are the matters of real consequence.
Isn&#39;t that so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not entirely. Her character and her past record are
of the utmost importance. Now, what do you know of her?
Not much, I&#39;ll be bound. No, my boy, when you do
finally decide to marry, you must choose some nice girl in
your own station of life. One who has been properly
brought up, and about whom there can be no question,
which is more than can be said for Miss Stornway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You presume most abominably upon our relationship,&quot;
Geoff was commencing angrily, but both his sentence and
the remainder of the conversation were doomed to remain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
unfinished. Hurried footsteps were heard in the hall, and
Jack charged into the room, crying&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, get some brandy or something quickly! Miss
Stornway has fainted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a feeling akin to despair had Evarne watched the
two men leave the studio. It had been so obviously a
mere contrivance on Morris&#39;s part to speak to his cousin
alone. Now the blow was to fall, and what possible means
had she of preventing it? A sudden consciousness of her
own weakness, her utter impotence, swept across her,
bringing something not unlike resignation in its train.
She would change her costume and go away&mdash;everything
was over! She stood up, but with the more commanding
attitude the fighting spirit rallied again. She would not
yield yet. She would strive till the very last.</p>

<p class="indent">The imperative need of the immediate moment was to
end that <i>tête-à-tête</i> now proceeding. Morris and Geoff
had been alone scarcely a couple of minutes. No harm
was perhaps done yet, but every second might be of consequence.
How was it to be stopped&mdash;how&mdash;how? She
cast about in her mind for an inspiration. Ah! was there
any wisdom in belonging to that sex that men designate
&quot;the weaker,&quot; and yet never taking advantage of it in
emergencies such as this? Without a second thought she
gave a low cry, raised her hand to her head, let herself
drop heavily upon the floor, and there lay just as she had
fallen&mdash;motionless, helpless, with closed eyes and scarce
fluttering breath.</p>

<p class="indent">The anticipated result ensued. Half a minute later
Geoff was on his knees hanging over her in an agony of
dismay, while Winborough might have been absolutely
non-existent for all the attention he was able to command.</p>

<p class="indent">Every device known to man for the conquering of a fainting
attack did Evarne allow to be vainly essayed before
finally lifting her languid eyelids. A look of relief passed
over three anxious countenances. Winborough stood leaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
against the door, surveying the scene. His features bore
an expression that might have puzzled the uninitiated, but
Evarne understood. Meeting her eye, he smiled at her.
Their mutual glance was scarcely more than instantaneous,
but it was all-sufficient. She knew right well that not for
a moment had he been deceived by her pretended swoon.
Geoff&#39;s gaze, fixed intently on the face so dear to him, saw
a shadow of distress pass over it as a fleeting cloud. He
looked rapidly at Winborough over his shoulder, but no
explanation was forthcoming from that quarter, and he
turned all his attention again to his &quot;Sweet Lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was supported to the open window, ensconced in an
arm-chair; cushions were arranged behind her head; a
footstool was brought for her feet. More than once, as
Winborough watched all this care and attention, the same
mocking smile hovered around his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t leave me,&quot; murmured the invalid, laying her
hand upon Geoff&#39;s arm.</p>

<p class="indent">But even as she spoke she stole a glance at the man
standing by the door. He it was with whom an undisturbed
interview was essential. Each must learn the
other&#39;s mind&mdash;it was imperative.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have an idea that if I could say a few words to your
cousin while I&#39;m so ill, it might soften his heart towards
me,&quot; she whispered, after a brief period of perplexed
thought. &quot;Do arrange for me to have a minute or two
alone with him, to see if I cannot persuade him to think
more kindly of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will call him over if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I can&#39;t talk about you while you&#39;re listening.
That would be embarrassing for me, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Geoff was reluctant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he is in a nasty temper. He would very likely
say something to wound your feelings, and you have
borne more than enough lately. Don&#39;t bother about
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
&quot;I can&#39;t endure to make trouble between you. Do let
me try. He doesn&#39;t look very stern now,&quot; she declared.</p>

<p class="indent">Winborough was engaged in conversation with Jack and
Pallister, and was obviously making himself as pleasant as
he so well knew how to do when he chose. Nevertheless,
Geoff frowned slightly and shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">But with a very little more perseverance, Evarne, as
usual, got her own way. A few minutes later she found
her enemy standing by the side of her chair in an otherwise
empty room, and heard herself directly addressed by that
voice which, above all others, she had hoped and believed
would never fall upon her ears again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you accept my compliments upon your really
admirable presence of mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sat erect with amazing alertness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Morris! So you are his cousin?&quot; she cried, for the
first time allowing the full horror she felt to appear in both
tone and expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most unfortunate, isn&#39;t it?&quot; he agreed. &quot;If it had
been any other man whatsoever I wouldn&#39;t have spoiled
your little game. As it is, of course&mdash;well, I&#39;m sure you
will understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you really suppose I&#39;m going to give him up quietly,
simply to please you?&quot; she demanded&mdash;then added hastily,
&quot;But we can&#39;t talk about it here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is there anything to discuss? Oh, I understand.
Pardon my dullness. We&#39;ll make that all right. I&#39;m not
ungenerous. Where are you living? Where can I come
and see you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So he was actually taking her words to imply that she
wanted money. She opened her lips, ready with an indignant
denial, but stopped short. Let him labour under
this delusion for the time being. It was a decided advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">She gave him her address.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
&quot;I am posing here all day,&quot; she explained. &quot;You can
come in the evening at half-past seven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am engaged to-night. Expect me to-morrow. I&#39;ll
drop in after I&#39;ve dined. Somewhere between eight and
nine. I say, Evarne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won&#39;t throw the furniture at me, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She found no answer for this taunt. Leaning back in
the chair, she turned her head wearily away, while a couple
of big tears gathered in her eyes. He was very brutal&mdash;very
heartless. What was she to do, or say to him?</p>

<p class="indent">In another minute the door had swung to behind him,
and Geoff was bending over her.</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up mournfully, while the big tears overflowed
and trickled unrestrainedly down her cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was quite useless,&quot; she murmured brokenly. &quot;He
is absolutely determined to prevent our marriage. Oh,
Geoff, my dearest, I am so unhappy. What am I to do?
I love you so much.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXV" id="chXXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV<br />
<small>THE STROKE OF SEKHET</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> resonant strokes of great clocks boomed forth
the third hour after midnight; the sounds faded
away languidly upon the heavy air, and silence
reigned once more over the sleeping city. Evarne
wandering downstairs, leaned out of the landing-window
counting the tones, listened until they had died into nothingness,
then, with a shuddering sigh, continued her way
to the sitting-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Hour after hour throughout this seemingly endless night
had she wandered over her little house, pacing to and fro
distractedly in every room in turn. Morris Kenyon had
come again into her life, and to stop her marriage would,
if necessary, ruthlessly betray her secret to Geoff. It was
beyond any possibility of doubt. That brief interview
with him had clearly shown his intention. What power
had she to prevent it? He would tell all&mdash;and then&mdash;what
then? Even in imagination the results were well-nigh
insupportable. And this approaching blow would
not&mdash;could not&mdash;fall on herself alone; and in this reflection
there lay a sting potent as that of the torturing gadfly
that drove Io of old wandering over land and water seeking
peace in vain.</p>

<p class="indent">Why, why had she ever risked this calamity? She
ought to have told Geoff the whole truth about herself
directly she saw he was growing really to care for her.
But now, as an additional offence, she had been guilty of
such brazen lies; had deceived him both by words and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
silences so continually and deliberately. Her whole conduct
towards him must now appear shameful, utterly dishonourable.
It was almost impossible to hope that his
affection would endure in the face of such dire discoveries,
it was quite out of the question to expect him afterwards
implicitly to believe even her strongest assertions. Strive
as she might to explain her motives, to excuse trickery that
she could not deny, however earnestly she should plead,
mourn, regret, she could never do away with these damning,
irrefutable facts. What would Geoff think and say and
do? Surely his revulsion of feeling would be terrible and
complete?</p>

<p class="indent">And if, despite all, he could not cease to care for her&mdash;why,
so much the worse for him! He who so desired to
reverence where he loved could feel but contempt, or at
least mere forgiving, generous pity. In place of trust and
glad confidence&mdash;doubt, surmise, unrest. Better far for
her &quot;dreamer&quot; if all memory of her could fade entirely
from his thoughts. To love with the heart and despise
with the intellect&mdash;it could be done. But it was cruel
suffering; it bordered on the unendurable! She herself
knew only too well the mental torture that such complex
emotions imply. Was she to be the means of forcing Geoff
to acquire this bitter knowledge?</p>

<p class="indent">During the passing of the weary hours her thoughts had
travelled widely. Not only had she shuddered at the revelations
of that day, and sickened with horror for the future,
but memories of the hateful past had pressed upon her with
resolute persistency.</p>

<p class="indent">And in that retrospect it seemed that bygone days had
failed to show her the uttermost possibilities of mental
anguish. Not throughout the long-protracted pain of
striving against Lucinda Belmont&#39;s successful rivalry; not
in that moment of humiliation and agony of spirit when
Morris had bade her leave him for Tony; not the year of
grinding poverty and overwork that followed&mdash;none of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
this had brought the cruellest last drops of the cup of misery
so near her shrinking lips as did the present hour. She
knew now that she could taste of these final dregs by one
means only&mdash;by seeing her own deeds used as the weapon
wherewith to shatter the happiness of the man she loved
far more dearly then life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Geoff, Geoff, forgive me!&quot; she cried aloud, and buried
her face in her hands.</p>

<p class="indent">How cruel it all seemed! Could it be mere chance that
so often made a sport, a mockery, of just the highest hopes
and prospects&mdash;of the sunshine of the present&mdash;of the
sweetest amidst past memories? Hot rebellion awoke
within her heart, so surely did it seem that some subtle
malignity, some deliberate spitefulness, had been at work
shaping her life from the very day of her birth, when she
lost her mother, guiding and controlling events until they
culminated in this coil of torment. Or perchance it had
all been preordained by some Supreme Being as a test, a
needful trial. Yet again, may be, she, and Geoffrey too,
were but working out their own salvation, fated to endure
in order to expiate evil wrought in some forgotten existence;
that she ought to be resigned, and, rebelling no
longer, to submit patiently to sorrow both for herself and
for him.</p>

<p class="indent">Ah, mystery of suffering! Can blind mortal eyes pierce
the veil? Can a heart torn with ardent earthly love find
comfort in the shadowy dreams of philosophers or mystics?</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne flung herself upon the couch, pressing her face
despairingly into the cushions. And in the blackness
arose, clear and distinct, a mental vision of that little
Temple of Sekhet far away in the land of Egypt. How
minutely could she recall the terrifying aspect of the goddess
who held dominion over Love, over its joy and its cruelty.
Almost with the vividness of reality could she see those
ominous features&mdash;that flat head with its receding brow,
beneath which no wise benevolence, no tender charity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
could ever find place. And in the mental picture, the
narrow gleaming eyes seemed reading the agony of her
spirit with malicious deliberation, the long lips were parted
over sharp teeth with a devilish smile of amusement and
gratification.</p>

<p class="indent">She started erect and gazed around the familiar room,
seeking to clear her mind of such spectres. But the train
of thought was not to be got rid of so easily.</p>

<p class="indent">Surely those long-dead priests of Egypt had been verily
inspired when they represented this divinity under the
guise of a cat-headed creature? Ah, &quot;Crusher of Hearts&quot;
supreme, with your sheer delight in torturing all that falls
helplessly within your power&mdash;with your eyes that have the
gift of seeing clearly how and where to strike when the
vision of all others is dulled! But they should have given
you cat&#39;s paws, Sekhet&mdash;cruel, tearing talons concealed in
sheaths softer than velvet!</p>

<p class="indent">There was surely the &quot;Mark of the Beast&quot; upon this
fate that had befallen her. After so many years of dull
monotony, to be allowed once again to behold prospects of
the truest happiness&mdash;to enjoy so brief a spell of love and
joy&mdash;just a taste of life&#39;s sweetest possibilities. Then this
crushing blow, this darkening of the heavens, this blight
upon the earth, this upheaval of the depths!</p>

<p class="indent">She moved restlessly around the room for a few minutes,
then wandered upstairs again. She longed for the temporary
forgetfulness of sleep, but how vain to seek it with
a mind in so wild a turmoil. The very atmosphere seemed
stifling. Half lifting aside the dressing-table that stood
before the window, she flung wide the lower sash, and bringing
a chair, rested her folded arms upon the sill and gazed
into the night.</p>

<p class="indent">Out of doors all was quiet and peaceful indeed. The
moon still rode high, flinging clear-cut fantastic shadows
upon road and pavement. No sound was to be heard, no
human being to be seen.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
Yet the mere sight of the street brought a fresh pang to
her already overburdened heart. While Philia was away
posing at the Polytechnic Art class that evening there had
come a knock at the door which Evarne had disregarded
entirely. A second rap was treated with like contempt;
the outside world with its demands was non-existent to
her that night. But the current of her thoughts had been
disturbed, and at the third attempt she became sufficiently
interested in this perseverance to stand concealed by the
window-curtains to watch who went away.</p>

<p class="indent">After a time a figure had appeared and walked slowly
down the street. It was Geoff himself. He had driven
home with her at five o&#39;clock, and here, but a few hours
later, was apparently already anxious for fresh news. To
see the road, brought this little incident vividly to her
memory. Was she to lose such care and devotion? And
to think that Geoff&mdash;with all his kindness and unfailing
tenderness towards the weakest living thing, his trust and
his true love for herself&mdash;was to be nothing more than one
of Sekhet&#39;s innumerable victims!</p>

<p class="indent">She dragged down the blind sharply, to shut out the
sight of the road, then made up her mind at least to lie
down and strive to sleep. But early risers were already
abroad before her eyelids even closed, and she seemed
scarcely to have lost consciousness before Philia aroused
her.</p>

<p class="indent">The old woman had not been as blind to the girl&#39;s troubled
state as Evarne supposed. Far from sleeping complacently
all night, she had lain awake long, listening to the gentle
footsteps in the house, grieving over the sorrow that had
so evidently descended upon the one who was dearest to
her of all the world. Thus her voice was quite apologetic
as she called out&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry to wake yer, my pet, but I&#39;ve let yer sleep
as long as ever is possible if you&#39;re goin&#39; to be at that
studio by nine. It&#39;s jist on eight o&#39;clock already.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
&quot;I&#39;ll get up at once,&quot; Evarne answered, and she went
so far towards carrying out her good intention as to immediately
sit up in bed. But as the memory of the events
of the previous day came upon her, she promptly sank
down again with a renewal of despair.</p>

<p class="indent">But although lamentation and fear were permissible in
the night hours, with the morning must come a renewal of
courage and energy&mdash;so she told herself, at least; and with
the determination of acting up to this resolution, sprang
lightly out of bed, and, crossing the room, drew up the
blind.</p>

<p class="indent">But either the energy of her uprising after such a night,
or the sudden blaze of morning light, rendered her suddenly
dizzy. She shut her eyes and leant for a moment
on the dressing table. When she opened them again the
first thing she saw was her own reflection in the mirror.
She surveyed it with stern disapproval. What a sight she
was, with pale cheeks and those blue circles under the eyes!
She looked every whit as ugly as she felt&mdash;dazed and sleepy
and silly. Suddenly she made up her mind to stay at
home. There was no real need to call upon her resources
until the evening brought the interview with Morris. She
would avoid the unnecessary effort of concealing her distress
and anxiety from Geoff.</p>

<p class="indent">She went out on to the landing, and, leaning over the
banisters, called for Philia. The old woman opened the
door of the kitchen, from whence issued the hissing sound
of frying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bring me up a cup of tea&mdash;nice and strong. I don&#39;t
want anything to eat. I&#39;m not going to the studio this
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then returning to her room, she sat down and wrote to
Geoff.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">Dearest of all</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you mind very much if I don&#39;t come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
to-day? I have had such a restless night, it has made
me look so ugly I don&#39;t want you to see me. There&#39;s
vanity! Really, I do feel quite unwell&mdash;not actually
ill, you know, but not up to posing. I feel sure I should
only break more precious vases, so I had better not come,
though it is hard not to see you for a whole day, my
Geoff.</p>

<p class="center">&quot;Your lazy</p>

<p class="author">&quot;<span class="smcap">Evarne</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="indent">As she took the tea from Philia&#39;s hands she gave her the
note.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Send this by district messenger. Go at once, there&#39;s
a dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Won&#39;t yer tell me what&#39;s the matter, my pet? It&#39;s all
troublin&#39; me, it is, straight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s nothing to worry about in a bad night, is
there, now? When you come back don&#39;t wake me. I&#39;m
going to sleep again if I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Evarne did not leave it to chance. When she had
nearly finished her tea she produced a tiny blue bottle from
the drawer of the washing-stand, carefully counted out
five-and-twenty drops, shook her cup round several times,
then swallowed tea and chlorodyne together to the last
dreg. Lowering the blind she got back into bed and was
soon fast asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">It was three o&#39;clock before she descended to the sitting-room.
On the table was a cluster of sweet-peas and roses,
together with a note.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did Mr. Danvers send these?&quot; she inquired, as she
tore open the envelope.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;E brought &#39;em &#39;imself. My gosh, dearie, &#39;e is properly
careful of you. &#39;E knocked so soft I &#39;ardly &#39;eard &#39;im, and
&#39;e looked that worried.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I&#39;ve already started to grieve him,&quot; reflected
Evarne grimly, as she proceeded to read his letter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">&quot;<span class="smcap">My poor precious Darling</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t tell you how terrible it is to me to
think of you as weak and suffering ... my bright-eyed,
rosy-lipped Evarne. And I feel that really it is all
my fault in one way and another.... I&#39;m sure it
is not surprising that yesterday should have upset you....
It&#39;s a delicate, sensitive soul, I know, for all the
glorious vitality of the flesh. Only get well quickly, my
best and dearest, and I&#39;ll guard you better in future. Get
strong quickly, for my sake, who love you so, and you shall
have permission to smash every vase in the studio to your
heart&#39;s content ... you darling!</p>

<p class="author">&quot;<span class="smcap">Geoff.</span>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">She put this little note in the bosom of her gown, as she
went out to the kitchen in response to Philia&#39;s call to
dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">After the little meal she got out her drawing materials,
and made some pretence at working. But her pencil
moved almost mechanically over the paper as her mind
rehearsed all she could possibly find to say to Morris&mdash;the
pleas, the arguments she could place before him to turn
him from his present purpose. Slowly though time crept,
she watched its steady progress with dismay, and as the
afternoon waned there arose within her an ever-increasing
fear, not so much of the interview that loomed ahead, as
of its result. She tried to force herself to think only hopefully
regarding its issue, but all the time in her innermost
consciousness she seemed to know that failure was a foregone
conclusion. How futile to strive to alter Morris&#39;s
set determination&mdash;above all when, for once in his life, he
would be able to flatter himself that he was standing firm
in the cause of right and justice.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<h2><a name="chXXXVI" id="chXXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />
<small>A FRESH VOW</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">By</span> six o&#39;clock the sedentary occupation had become
too trying. Evarne changed her dressing-gown
for a coat and skirt, and went out.</p>

<p class="indent">All this erratic behaviour caused Philia not a
little concern and alarm. As a general rule Evarne was
so very placid and level-headed, that this disregard of all
precedent, this wandering about in the dark and sleeping
in the daylight, this neglect of work, meals at extraordinary
hours, and all the rest of the disorganising of respectable
routine, was not an occurrence to be treated lightly.
Still, in Philia&#39;s experience of human nature, directly a
girl must needs go and fall in love, troubles and upsets and
excitements followed as an inevitable corollary, while calm
quiet contentment took unto itself wings. Thus she did
not consider the root-cause of the present state of affairs
to be enshrouded in unsolvable mystery. Although she
was rather hurt at not being made a confidante, she evinced
no curiosity, being fairly satisfied that clouds of such a
nature almost always pass away in due course.</p>

<p class="indent">But when half an hour later she answered a knock at the
door and discovered Geoff, she greeted him with anything
but an amiable countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How is she now?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Guess she&#39;s better agin, for she&#39;s gorn out to git a
breath o&#39; fresh air. Will yer please to step in and wait.
I dare say she would like to see yer when she comes back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
Needing no second invitation, Geoff followed Mrs.
Harbert into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">The pretty little sitting-room was full of Evarne&#39;s personality.
Here were the flowers he had brought her;
here too were her books, her drawing-board, her writing-case;
there was the embroidered footstool on which she
had sat during his previous visit. Everything sang to him
of Evarne. There were the really charming pictures on the
walls, signed with her initials, that she had amazed him by
showing as her own handiwork. There was her little work-box,
and across it lay the long strip of embroidery on which
he had seen her diligently creating silken blossoms. Moved
by a sudden longing to hold in his hand something that
she had touched, Geoff picked up this and surveyed it with
the minute scrutiny of an apparent connoisseur in art
needlework.</p>

<p class="indent">Philia was speaking to him somewhat reproachfully.
She imagined that now, having the culprit under her
thumb, she could, with all due regard for politeness, give
him a &quot;piece of her mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must tell yer first that I ain&#39;t bin told who it is
worryin&#39; my pore gal, but I warrant if they&#39;d bin &#39;ere to
see &#39;er last night they&#39;d &#39;ave bin fair ashamed of themselves.
She was roamin&#39; the &#39;ouse like a wanderin&#39; spirit, and in
the mornin&#39; she was jist as white as &#39;er nightgown. It
seems to me that to make anyone really un&#39;appy without
rhyme or reason&mdash;and I won&#39;t believe Evarne is in the
wrong&mdash;as I was sayin&#39;, to make anyone real miserable is
a big thing to &#39;ave on one&#39;s mind in this &#39;ere world o&#39; sin
and woe, full o&#39; the slings and arrers of houtrageous fortune
as it is&mdash;Shakespeare! In plain talk, sir, a world where
we&#39;re all certain to &#39;ave quite enough trouble to digest
without them as we cares for most forcin&#39; a hextry dose
down our gullets. And no stray flowers, nor even rings
nor sich-like, makes up for unkindness&mdash;not to the noble
mind&mdash;Shakespeare! I&#39;ve lived with Evarne for five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
years and more, and she&#39;s never &#39;ad one hour&#39;s sorrow
through my fault. Hexcuse me if I&#39;m takin&#39; liberties I
didn&#39;t ought, but you&#39;ve bin &#39;ome from foreign parts less
than a week, and for some reason or other now she&#39;s made
fair miserable&mdash;by someone or other! I&#39;m not sayin&#39; by
who, but it&#39;s very &#39;ard for me to see it and not say nothin&#39;
at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philia paused, somewhat apprehensive at having thus
let her feelings carry her away. But Geoff was not displeased
by this ardent championship.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Mrs. Harbert,&quot; he said seriously, &quot;if it is my
fault&mdash;and to a certain extent I&#39;m afraid it is&mdash;believe me
that it was both unintentional and indirect. Evarne shall
never have a moment&#39;s trouble that I can save her from,
be very sure of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He walked to the window and looked out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder where she is now?&quot; he went on. &quot;Do you
think she will be long?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t say where she is. She jist says, &#39;It&#39;s suffocatin&#39;
indoors,&#39; she says, and out she goes. Most likely she&#39;ll be
back by seven. Anyway, I&#39;m due at the &#39;Poly&#39; at &#39;alf-past.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve always posed, haven&#39;t you, Mrs. Harbert?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philia was decidedly a trifle aggrieved by this query, and
answered in wounded tones&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, sir, if yer was a few years older, yer wouldn&#39;t
need to ask that. There was a time when every hartist in
London knew all about Philadelphia &#39;Arbert, and it wasn&#39;t
sich a great time ago either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evidently I don&#39;t know much?&quot; queried Geoff with
a good-natured smile.</p>

<p class="indent">The reply was certainly cutting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You never &#39;eard tell of Philadelphia &#39;Arbert as a model,
and you don&#39;t know &#39;ow to keep yer sweet&#39;eart&#39;s eyes dry.
Well, sir, askin&#39; yer pardin&#39;, but you &#39;ave got somethin&#39; to
learn!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
The young man bit his lip and did not answer. This
silence melted his outspoken critic immediately, and she
set to work to be amiable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hexcuse me if I&#39;m rather sharp, but it is &#39;ard to &#39;ave
bin famous once and to find yer &#39;ard-earned fame all gorn.
Why, I can remember the time when any hartist gentlemen
as wanted to bring Venus or any other of them &#39;eathen
young women into a picture, didn&#39;t feel &#39;e&#39;d done all he
could to &#39;elp &#39;imself until &#39;e&#39;d got me to pose for &#39;im.
That&#39;s a fact, sir! I&#39;d a lovely figger when I was a gal.
None o&#39; the young women now, only exceptin&#39; Evarne,
comes up to what models was in my young days, and I&mdash;well,
my gosh! I&#39;ve &#39;ad a long string o&#39; great painters
waitin&#39; their turn till I was disengaged and could oblige.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It must have been both pleasant and profitable to be
in such demand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Harbert looked down with becoming modesty, and
smoothed her apron as she replied&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir, it was, but I never let myself get huppish
about it. I was only as the Lord chose to make me. I
used to say sometimes, &#39;Beauty is as beauty does,&#39; and
&#39;Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a
flower; lost, faded&#39;&mdash;I forget the rest&mdash;&#39;within the hour&#39;&mdash;Shakespeare.
I&#39;ve sat for Lord Leighton and Millais
and Watts and &#39;eaps of others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you have posed for some quite well-known
pictures, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My gosh! a picture painted in those days, when Hart
was properly understood, &#39;adn&#39;t much chance of bein&#39;
thought &#39;ighly of if the hartist &#39;adn&#39;t taken care to git me
to collaborate with &#39;im.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, that&#39;s a really original idea of yours, Mrs. Harbert&mdash;that
a painter and his model collaborate. Did you
tell it to the men you sat for, and what did they say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, sir, truth is, I doubt if any of the hartists that
I&#39;ve &#39;elped to gain positions they&#39;d never &#39;ave got to without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
me, would be willin&#39; to acknowledge it. But there, that&#39;s
only the way o&#39; the world. Shakespeare &#39;e wrote a
song about hingratitude, as I dare say you&#39;ve &#39;eard
sung.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t it very interesting to be able to look back on the
famous pictures you&#39;ve posed for?&quot; inquired Geoff, with
another fleeting glance out of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is that! Why, I was that proud the first time I was
in a picture that was the &#39;it of the season. I was &#39;Harry&mdash;Harry&mdash;hadney.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ain&#39;t yer never &#39;eard of &#39;er, pore gal? She&#39;s bin deserted
on a island by some skulkin&#39; brute, so she knelt down
with next to nothin&#39; on, and &#39;eld out both &#39;er &#39;ands to the
sea. It was like this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Rendered enthusiastic by her reminiscences, Philia sank
down on the carpet, leant forward, flung back her head
and imploringly extended both her hands. The effect had
probably been charming when the model was youthful and
fair, but now it put a severe demand on Geoff&#39;s good
manners not to smile at the old dame.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was real touchin&#39;,&quot; she declared, as she rose to her
feet with some difficulty, &quot;but it nearly gave me &#39;ousemaid&#39;s
knee! Then there was another picture that made
a lot o&#39; talk. It was called the &#39;Race of Hatalanta.&#39; She
was runnin&#39; fit to catch the last train &#39;ome. I shan&#39;t
forget that pose in a &#39;urry. My gosh, I can&#39;t even think
of it without my left leg beginnin&#39; to ache!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the street door was heard to open.
According to her usual custom Evarne had let herself in
with her latchkey.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There she is,&quot; said Philia, and stepping out into the
passage she announced in somewhat triumphant tones,
&quot;There&#39;s a gentleman &#39;ere waitin&#39; to see yer, dearie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After an interval of somewhat unaccountable duration,
Evarne appeared in the doorway. As she beheld Geoff her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
whole expression changed, her lips parted into a smile, her
eyes lit up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it is you! I am so very glad, so delighted!&quot;
she gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I won&#39;t be hintrudin&#39; no longer,&quot; declared Philia
as she left the room.</p>

<p class="indent">But her absence or presence was unmarked at that moment.
Evarne was in Geoff&#39;s arms, and each was gazing
at the other as if years of separation had intervened between
this moment and their last meeting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am so very glad you have come,&quot; declared Evarne
again. &quot;You cannot tell how badly I have wanted you.
I felt as if I should die if I couldn&#39;t see you! Do you know
where I have been? No, how should you? I have been
to your studio! I don&#39;t mean upstairs, but I walked past
and looked up at the window. I hoped you might just
happen to look out. I did want you so much; I wanted
comforting so badly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evarne, every time I see you, you make me love you
even more devotedly than I did before. But how truly
wicked to want to see me, and not send a message at once.
I have been thinking about you every minute of the day.
Dearest, tell me, are you worrying so sadly about anything
Winborough said?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the whole thing&mdash;the whole business. Oh, why
could you not have been poor? Why could not you have
been just an ordinary person, so that we could have lived
for one another, without anyone having either the wish or
the right to interfere? I am so afraid of your cousin&mdash;and
worse still, I know that everyone will be on his side. I feel
the force of the entire world against me, and it&#39;s crushing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we can safely defy the whole world to weaken our
love for one another, can&#39;t we, my best and dearest?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She wrenched herself suddenly from his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know!&mdash;I don&#39;t know! How can we be
sure of anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
So saying, she flung herself down amid the cushions of
the big velvet arm-chair. Geoff stood motionless for a
moment, then seating himself on one of its wide arms, he
leaned over, resting his hand upon the opposite side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then know this henceforward, Evarne. You may
with perfect confidence defy not only the world, headed by
Winborough, but you may safely defy even yourself to
destroy the love I have for you. You might wound me,
and disappoint me, even forget me, yet while I live I shall
love you, and after death also, if Heaven pleases. What
more can I say than that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it&#39;s a very pretty sentiment, anyhow,&quot; was the
lightly-spoken, almost mocking reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then truth is not always ugly,&quot; he answered quietly
enough, but Evarne could see that he was not unmoved by
her jeering tones. Impulsively she flung her arms around
his neck, and drew his face down to hers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Geoffrey, I&#39;m years and years&mdash;I&#39;m centuries older than
you in spirit. I have suffered so much in previous existences
that my soul still retains its scars. Truth has always
appeared to me so sad of countenance, that when I see it
with a smiling face I dread deception. Yes, indeed. In
my mind Truth is invariably so grim, so menacing, so destructive,
that when anything appears in beautiful guise
and calls itself Truth, I instinctively mistrust it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I suppose I can do nothing but wait, and let time
prove my words.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden impulse&mdash;a longing&mdash;seized Evarne to confess
everything&mdash;there on the spot, without any preparation or
delay. To take him at his word, to shatter his ideal, and
see if the love he thought so invincible could really endure.
What a triumphant answer to Morris&mdash;to meet him with
Geoff by her side&mdash;Geoff knowing all, and unchanged by
knowledge!</p>

<p class="indent">She sought for words with which to commence, but in
the moment&#39;s hesitation she chanced to look full into his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
clear grey eyes. It was no use. A cold chill seized her,
and a feeling almost of physical sickness. She was ashamed.
It was impossible to find language for this task that her
tongue could be brought to utter. She felt her cheeks
flush red, and partly covered her face with her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">So much for this half-hearted attempt at confession.
And as the impulse passed, a great thankfulness arose that
she had not yielded to its wiles. That Geoff loved her now
was as certain as that he lived, and at that very moment she
could feel his warm breath upon her brow. But he spoke
with untried confidence. Had he not once declared, practically
in so many words, that he would rather see her dead
than have aught destroy his love for her? He had, indeed,
made an attempt to contradict himself a moment later;
but she held those words to be the genuine offspring of
truth&mdash;representative of his most usual frame of mind. No,
her task was not to anticipate, but to strive to ward off
the evil hour of disillusionment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My true lover,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I know you are
faithful and loyal and constant, and I believe you would
be long-suffering. I trust you, depend upon you now, and
rely upon you for the future without a single doubt or a
moment&#39;s hesitation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And, dearest, am I to feel the same about you? Will
you be always faithful and constant to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Geoff, always, always.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then all is well. I half feared that if Winborough got
a chance to talk to you alone, and perhaps bullied and
argued and persuaded and appealed to your affection for
me, and all that sort of thing, you might perchance be led
to imagine that you were really ensuring my ultimate
happiness by going away and leaving no trace whereby I
could discover you again. One hears of such things, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I thought it would be really best for you, be sure I
would&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
&quot;Evarne, my dear&mdash;my dearest&mdash;remember&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Geoff, I do remember, whatever it might be you
were going to remind me of, for I forget nothing. I do
believe I can make you happy. You hear that? I firmly
believe I can make your life happier than it could be without
me. That belief is the foundation of all my actions.
Will you always remember that? Please take it into your
very heart of hearts, and let it fix itself there indelibly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For some time they sat silent. With Geoff so very near
to her, Evarne became conscious of a gentle calm, a certain
sense of peace, a despondency that was mournful, but less
desperate. It was with an effort that she finally roused
herself sufficiently to take his watch out from his pocket
and look at the time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seven&mdash;seven o&#39;clock and past!&quot; she sighed, replacing
it. &quot;Ah me! You mustn&#39;t think, dear, that I&#39;m
dreadfully rude and inhospitable, but I&#39;m afraid I must
ask you not to stay any longer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh&mdash;h!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s no use saying &#39;oh&#39; in that dolorous manner,&quot; she
declared, smiling. &quot;You see&mdash;it&#39;s this way&mdash;old Philia
has to leave here for the &#39;Poly&#39; about seven. She will be
going in a few minutes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But we don&#39;t mind, do we? We don&#39;t want the old
lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne cast down her eyes. The only excuse that had
crossed her mind for getting Geoff out of the house struck
her as being decidedly petty and unworthy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is stupid, I know well; but people do talk so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, silly little Evarne, you are surely not bothering
about Mrs. Grundy and the neighbours, are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a somewhat feeble and shamefaced smile she rose
up from out the depths of the chair, and replied only by
fetching his hat and offering it to him with a little curtsey.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s only till to-morrow. I shall come to the studio
just as usual.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
The young man took the proffered hat with undisguised
reluctance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, I cannot stay if my hostess turns me out
thus firmly,&quot; he grumbled, &quot;but I&#39;m sure it is not necessary.
I believe you&#39;re tired of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head confidently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m very sure you don&#39;t think that really.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His momentary ill-humour died away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I don&#39;t, dear heart. I dare say you are in
the right. Everything you do is perfect, only&mdash;I warn
you&mdash;you will have to marry me sooner than ever for this.
Can&#39;t you settle on a definite date by to-morrow? Do try.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She disregarded his question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not vexed. You did frown at me, you
did, and it made you look&mdash;oh, terribly ugly&mdash;just like a
mediæval gargoyle.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You and Mrs. Harbert have certainly entered into a
conspiracy with a view to reducing me to a proper condition
of self-depreciation,&quot; declared Geoff, smiling at the
lofty expression of disdain with which his &quot;Sweet Lady&quot;
was still surveying him. He shifted his hat from one hand
to the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come out with me, Evarne. Let us go and have something
to eat, and then on to a theatre or somewhere, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve still got the tiniest little headache; I would
rather not,&quot; she declared. &quot;Good-bye, dearest.&quot; Then,
correcting herself somewhat wildly: &quot;No, no. I didn&#39;t
mean good-bye&mdash;only good-night! Don&#39;t speak ill-omened
words, Geoff. Only say good-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At length he was gone. Evarne pressed her hand to her
forehead. This unexpected visit had both weakened and
strengthened her.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few minutes she went upstairs to change her dress.
Hearing the approaching steps, Philia, who was in her own
room tying on her bonnet, called out, and as the girl entered
she inquired&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
&quot;Are yer any &#39;appier now, my pet? Is it all right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really are fond of me, aren&#39;t you, Philia?&quot;
queried Evarne meditatively, without replying to the question
she had been asked. Then, without waiting for any
response to her own demand, she went on: &quot;Would you
mind doing a little errand for me? The classes at the
&#39;Poly&#39; end at ten, don&#39;t they? Will you go afterwards
to Edith Gordon&#39;s and ask her for the blouse pattern she
promised to lend me? It isn&#39;t very far out of your way,
and you can stop and have a chat if she is in, can&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right yer are,&quot; assented Philia cordially, and five
minutes later the door had closed behind her.</p>

<p class="indent">At length the coast was quite clear for Morris&#39;s visit.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne carefully studied her three tea-gowns. It was
an important point. The green one was a great favourite
with everybody, but it was undeniably getting old. The
crimson cashmere with the black lace suited her splendidly,
but both colour and material looked rather heavy for such
hot weather. The pale yellow was the most suitable, and
she would wear a harmonising cluster of sweet-peas.</p>

<p class="indent">Although every nerve in her body seemed to be now on
edge, she did not neglect the least detail of her toilette,
and at its completion could not but realise that she was
indeed fair to behold. She had quite got back her colour,
and that peculiar sparkling brilliance that was her characteristic
beauty. Her luxurious dark hair, faintly scented
and piled high upon her head, was held in place by ornamental
combs. Long enamel earrings, gleaming blue and
green, served to emphasise the soft carnation bloom of the
cheeks they hung against, while a brooch of the same
iridescent tones held together the lace at the point of the
V-shaped opening of her gown. Then she put her diamond
engagement ring upon her finger, and, after a final critical
gaze into the mirror, descended the stairs. There she
drew the blinds and lit the lamp. It was five minutes past
eight. She sat down and waited.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXXVII" id="chXXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII<br />
<small>EVARNE FIGHTS FOR MORE THAN LIFE</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> silence was intense and oppressive; time
dragged painfully; every minute was fraught
with an entire round of mingled emotions. Fear
and trembling apprehension alternated with eager
impatience; stem determination, coupled with either
forced or spontaneous hope, would be followed by a crushing
sense of foregone failure and lack of self-confidence.
After a while this ceaseless ebullition of feeling brought on
actual physical fatigue, and Evarne leant back in her chair
with a growing sense of exhaustion.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly a sharp, loud knock broke the silence. Although
she had been expecting this&mdash;listening and waiting
for it&mdash;the sound came finally as a blow dealt her highly-strung
nerves. She gave a painful start, a gasp, and felt
the hot blood surge to her head. She sprang to her feet
at once, but then stood motionless. Now that Morris
Kenyon was actually upon her doorstep, every moment
that kept him from crossing the threshold seemed a priceless
respite.</p>

<p class="indent">She believed that she remained as if spellbound for many
minutes, but really only a brief time passed before she
aroused herself and went to the front door. With apparent
indifference she flung it half open, and at once returned to
sink into her favourite big arm-chair, leaving Morris to
enter, close the front door, and conduct himself along the
hall.</p>

<p class="indent">The light streaming from out the one room into the darkness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
served as a guide, and in a minute she heard his advancing
footsteps come to a standstill. She neither spoke
nor looked up, but remained impassive, her eyes fixed on
the beloved ring that sparkled upon her third finger.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris seemed well content to stand for a while in the
doorway, surveying her with a keen scrutiny. Then he
studied the surroundings, rapidly but with considerable
interest; glanced over his shoulder into the dense blackness
that enveloped the remainder of the house; listened
a moment to the heavy stillness that held sway; then
entered the room and closed the door, pausing calmly to
admire the crimson velvet portière, on which was some of
Evarne&#39;s exquisite embroidery. After laying down his
stick and hat on a little table and leisurely removing his
gloves, he drew up a chair close to his hostess, sat down,
and waited silently until she should choose to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">He was in evening dress, and though in the abstract
there was nothing to be surprised at in this sartorial detail,
Evarne found it inexplicably disconcerting. Without
raising her eyelids she contrived to study him through her
long lashes. He was indeed dignified and imposing; he
had lost none of his good looks; but the lines of his mouth
seemed even sterner, more inflexible than of yore. Past
memories rushed upon her mind. The leading events
and many apparently trifling details that had gone towards
making up nigh three years of her life passed now in rapid
progression before her mind&#39;s eye.</p>

<p class="indent">Verily she had loved this man at one time&mdash;she shrank
with self-loathing from recalling how devotedly. He it
was had been the cause of all those wild storms of emotion
that from time to time had convulsed her whole nature in
the throes either of ecstasy or of anguish. Quite apart
from the fact that he came at this crisis as the arbiter of
her future fate, it would have been impossible for her to
once more see him&mdash;to feel his near presence&mdash;and remain
entirely unmoved.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
Maybe some similar reflections passed through Morris&#39;s
mind. At all events, when ultimately he broke the silence,
his words referred, not directly to the business on hand, but
to the days that were gone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The presiding spirits at our exciting and interesting
farewell, five&mdash;six now, isn&#39;t it?&mdash;six years ago, were not
exactly those of Peace and Harmony, were they? Where
did the venturesome little birdie flutter when it left its
gilded cage, and what did it do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Considering the gravity of the circumstances to which
he was alluding, this light mode of address aroused all
Evarne&#39;s indignation. But she carefully concealed every
trace of resentment. So far her behaviour towards him
that evening had been decidedly cavalier; but it was undoubtedly
necessary, if she was to win her way with him,
that he should be deferred to&mdash;conciliated, rendered as
well disposed towards her as was possible. Thus she gently
answered his question by a brief though absolutely frank
recital of her short stage experience, her miseries at needlework
and subsequent illness, and her ultimate success as
an artist&#39;s model. She kept very much to generalities in
this account of how the years had passed with her, and
avoided the least mention of Geoffrey.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris listened with evident interest, and after a period
of silence had shown that she did not intend to proceed to
further details, he said carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve escaped monotony in life, at all events. But,
indeed, some new experiences have come the way of nearly
everybody you once knew. Tony Belmont married, and
is now a respectable, sober citizen with two children.
Lucinda is still in Paris, assailing hearts and banking
accounts with undiminished success&mdash;not mine, though!
Little&mdash;whatever was her name? Oh, Feronnier! A man
who once knew her told me he had seen her recently
haunting the back streets with a face pitted by small-pox!
I, to my own vast surprise, find myself, <i>nolens volens</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
an earl! My lady-wife, the countess, grows more tenacious
of life year by year. I should say also she has become more
disagreeable and unpleasant daily, if she hasn&#39;t already
arrived at an age when ugliness and unpleasantness in the
fair sex are such that there&#39;s no distinguishing of degrees.
Then Geoffrey Danvers finds himself my heir, with all the
resultant privileges and drawbacks&mdash;amongst the latter
being the dire necessity of marrying not merely to please
his own fancy, but with a certain regard to the demands
of his position.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At length this preamble had been man&oelig;uvred round to
the main point.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne leaned slightly forward in her anxiety, as she
demanded, without any circumlocution&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Morris, do you wish to prevent your cousin making me
his wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Unconsciously she held her breath while awaiting his
reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely such a question needs no answer?&quot; he said, a
certain sternness stealing into his voice. &quot;My chief
wonder is that you ever dared to think of marrying my
cousin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Explanation seemed but a waste of time, yet she found
herself saying in a somewhat tremulous voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I didn&#39;t know. They all speak of you by your
title, and I did not dream of connecting that name with
you. I never saw anything about the matter in the papers.
Five years ago I was doing needlework; I read nothing and
knew of nothing that happened outside my own four walls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Um! I understand,&quot; rejoined Morris reflectively.
Then with a sudden change of tone he continued&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, see here. You must realise that, as things have
turned out, this marriage is not to be thought of. While
no one who has ever known you, <i>ma chérie</i>, can possibly
connect Evarne and common sense together in their minds,
you are experienced enough by now, I dare say, to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
willing to admit that life has the drawback of being a serious
affair, and not a pretty romance. Therefore you will
surely see that the wisest thing you can do is to make the
best of a bad job, to accept the inevitable, and&mdash;shall we
say&mdash;travel a while? Now, travelling costs money, and
it is only fair that I, who am responsible for the necessity,
should pay the piper. There&#39;s a cheque in my pocket-book,
Evarne. If you will tell me what you think would be
sufficient to&mdash;to settle up things comfortably&mdash;I will fill it
in right away. Now, that&#39;s merely a business offer, to
avoid trouble and annoyance for us both,&quot; he added hastily,
noticing her changed expression. &quot;I don&#39;t need any
thanks, but at the same time I don&#39;t intend to put up
with any of the abuse to which you treated me the last
time I proposed concerning myself about your future.
Now, what sum will satisfy you? In any case you must
realise that your marriage with Geoffrey is absolutely impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne lay back in the big chair and surveyed the
speaker leisurely and critically. She was at a loss to decide
on the best manner of refusing even to consider this suggestion.
One variety of response after another flitted
through her mind. She dared venture on none of them.
She dreaded the effect her defiance would have upon him,
declare it gently and meekly as she might. Finally words
came, prompted by her protracted scrutiny of his cold,
resolute face. A quivering sigh escaped her, and speaking
half to herself she murmured&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How much I have suffered at your hands!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment his sympathy was aroused. He drew his
chair a trifle closer, and laid his hand upon her knee.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evarne, why in Heaven&#39;s name do such things happen?
On my honour, I&#39;m heartily grieved and worried over this
imbroglio.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With hope flashing into her eyes she suddenly sat erect
and caught at his arm.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
&quot;Then leave everything alone&mdash;dear, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her mellifluous voice was low and coaxing. Before he
could reply she went on&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let all the cruel, hateful past be forgotten. I can&mdash;I
will&mdash;be a good wife to Geoff. You should never, never
have the least reason to regret having permitted our
marriage&mdash;oh, I&#39;m certain! We are so strangely suited to
one another&mdash;our natures are thoroughly harmonious.
Oh, Morris, Morris, you don&#39;t know how much he cares for
me, and I&mdash;I love him with my whole heart, with all my
strength, with all that makes my life. We should be so
happy together&mdash;do let it be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris raised his hands, as if to request the opportunity
of replying. But Evarne did not, perhaps could not, cease
one instant in her impassioned appeal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know better than almost anyone that I am not
light-natured, or really indifferent to right and wrong.
You did care for me once&mdash;I know it&mdash;and there was a
time when I would have turned to you with perfect confidence
in any trouble. By the memory of those days, I
implore you not to drag me again into the lowest depths
of misery. And Geoff too&mdash;pity him, and spare him. Let
him live his own life, and love in peace, and marry as his
heart dictates. You can&#39;t always go by hard and fast
laws. I am sure, I am convinced, that the greatest good&mdash;that
nothing but good&mdash;could ever come from your
keeping silence upon the wrongs, the faults, the deceptions
and miseries that have gone by. Only fresh harm, more
widespread evil, immediate and life-long, irreparable and
unnecessary&mdash;oh think, so unnecessary&mdash;can arise from
your determination to oppose a marriage that would be&mdash;be....
Oh, Morris, we do love each other so much!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She flung her whole soul into this plea. As so often
happens, the actual words were by far the weakest part of
the appeal. It was her voice, low-pitched in its earnest
entreaty, and at times quivering and uncertain, that betrayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
most clearly the depth of her agitation&mdash;the vital
force of tortured feelings. And as these tremulous tones
died away, her entire personality continued to give the
impression that her very life hung upon Morris&#39;s response.
She leaned towards him; her fair face, so expressive, so
appealing, was very close to his. Those eager brown eyes,
now so full of passionate persuasion, seemed to burn to
his innermost consciousness. Not for one moment could
Morris doubt the reality of her deep affection for the man
she desired to marry.</p>

<p class="indent">He admired total abandonment of any sort. Something
of her old charm fell upon him, and for a passing
moment he came near to envying his young cousin the
possession of this all-dominating love that he himself had
once so lightly flung aside and disregarded. Thus, besides
the need of resisting the encroachment of sentiment upon
his resolve, he felt a touch of jealousy&mdash;a decided though
unacknowledged displeasure at finding the heart that was
once his footstool now so entirely emancipated from his
service. It was this sense of personal grievance that
caused him to answer her with a dash of that brutality
that came so easily to his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The saints protect me from the responsibility of disarranging
any ideal union, but the one you suggest is in
every way about as unsuitable as could possibly be imagined.
Doubtless you are absolutely devoted to Geoffrey&mdash;thousands
of girls could easily adore the heir to an earldom.
But forget your charming romantic feelings and
try to look at the matter from an impersonal point of view.
You are an artist&#39;s model. It may be the most refined
and elevating profession imaginable, but&mdash;well&mdash;we commonplace
people who belong neither to the race of poets
nor artists find it rather difficult to reconcile&mdash;well&mdash;you
comprehend? I won&#39;t press that point.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is nothing at all to Geoff!&quot; breathed Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then, if I understood rightly, you came very near to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
including utter starvation in that intensely interesting recital
of your experiences,&quot; he went on. &quot;Of course,
that&#39;s very sad&mdash;quite touching, in fact. But now, do
you suppose that a few years ahead we want troops of
American tourists trotting out to the slums to visit the
garret wherein the Countess of Winborough nearly starved?
I can assure you that, although I shan&#39;t be here, I object
very strongly to the possibility. Oh, Geoffrey thinks he
wouldn&#39;t mind, I dare say. I only wonder he hasn&#39;t already
painted a picture of you in rags and tatters gazing
into a cupboard like old Mother Hubbard and labelled it
&#39;Suffering Virtue.&#39; That&#39;s his belief about you, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne felt her whole body tingling with hot indignation.
She rose impetuously from the arm-chair, and walked
rapidly to the farther end of the room. Such was the overwhelming
hatred of this man that awoke again with renewed
power within her breast, that his near presence was
not to be endured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And isn&#39;t it true?&quot; she demanded, speaking quickly
and with impassioned emphasis. &quot;Is not the very phrase
that you are mean and base enough to fling at me in derision
nothing more nor less than Heaven&#39;s truth? Is it
not entirely because I did indeed prefer my own self-respect
to ill-gotten money that there is a showplace in London
such as you describe? That squalid room, and the cruel
ordeals I underwent within its walls, are the very witnesses
that testify to my claim to be held a good woman and a fit
wife for any man. Not a day passed without my enduring
more than you can ever realise. I was entirely without
hope for the future, yet never once&mdash;never once, I tell
you&mdash;did I regret the choice I had made.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That grinding poverty was no shame to me,&quot; she went
on, &quot;but a glory; and no one knows that better than you&mdash;you,
Morris Kenyon! And I would go back to it&mdash;live
and die in it&mdash;rather than lose my own consciousness
of virtue. You despicable coward! How dare you come here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
and taunt me with humiliations for which you alone are
responsible? Everything that is degrading and wretched
in my life has been brought into it by you. You indeed
did your best to turn me into a woman whom a man well
might fear to entrust with his name and with his honour,
but that garret cries out to you and to all the world the
story of your failure. It is infamous&mdash;vile&mdash;to bring forward
such an acceptance of poverty as a reason for opposing
your cousin&#39;s choice of me as his wife. It is infamous,
and you know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She paused, breathing hard, still struggling with a sense
of outrage. Her words had not been devoid of a certain
sting, and once or twice Morris had inwardly winced beneath
the onslaught. But circumstances placed every
advantage&mdash;every weapon of lasting keenness&mdash;into his
hands. Thus it was with unruffled complacency that he
declared&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Evarne, could you not contrive to conquer
this tendency to wax melodramatic? You know I dislike
it, and that it is always ineffective.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He waited a minute, half expecting her to answer. But
obedient to his expressed will Evarne succeeded in stifling
all retorts, and remained silent. Looking at her narrowly,
he could see signs of the effort she made over herself, and
smiled a little before he continued&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You force me to speak more plainly than I had hoped
would be necessary. Surely you must know that I do not
really need to adduce any exterior or subsequent details
of your career in support of my very natural objection to
this marriage. The one fact of your having been my mistress
is alone all-sufficient. Understand that, please!
You calmly ask me to allow Geoffrey to walk blindly into
the trap you have set for him, and hurl insults at my head
when I refuse! I should like to know what you expected?
Did you really believe I should become a party to this
deceit?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
But again he received no answer. Evarne simply looked
at him with eyes that had grown somewhat dilated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know he is absolutely without any suspicion,&quot; Morris
went on, &quot;for only yesterday the poor fool spoke of you in
a strain that almost caused me to laugh in his face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It needed such words, uttered in tones of such supreme
contempt, to bring home to Evarne the way in which others
must view the position in which she had placed Geoffrey.
The knowledge assailed her cruelly. A physical pain, keen
as a knife, shot through her forehead from one temple to
the other. Crossing to the sofa, she sat down, twisted her
hands tightly together, shut her eyes, and waited while
the sharp pang gradually passed away.</p>

<p class="indent">Without turning right round, Morris was no longer able
to see her. Accordingly, he got up and sank into the arm-chair
she had vacated. But a minute later Evarne was on
her knees by his side. The new horror that his last words
had aroused, goaded her into making yet another effort
at persuasion. Leaning against the soft, wide arm of the
chair, she cried somewhat wildly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I haven&#39;t told him, because somehow the occasion
never seemed to come until he loved me so much that I
couldn&#39;t endure to speak the cruel truth. And you mustn&#39;t
tell him now, Morris&mdash;oh, you mustn&#39;t! If only you
will keep silent, neither he nor anybody else will ever
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you flatter yourself, but these things always leak
out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This wouldn&#39;t&mdash;how could it? We were abroad practically
all the time&mdash;no one here knows. Besides, nobody
at all can be really certain. There was always the
veil of a plausible explanation of our being together. You
didn&#39;t pick me up from nowhere. My father left me in
your charge&mdash;everyone at Heatherington knew that.
I worked steadily at Art all the time. There is scarcely
the remotest possibility of anyone ever trying to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
mischief; but if they did, then you and I together could
absolutely defy them. We could, couldn&#39;t we? Morris, I
beg of you&mdash;I implore your mercy&mdash;keep my secret. It
can be done, and I am sure&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Morris interposed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not a bit of use continuing, my dear. Such a proceeding
on my part would be most dishonourable towards
my cousin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be the truest kindness to him. And have I no
claims upon your honour? Will it allow you to betray me
without scruple? Do you owe me no consideration whatsoever?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You view everything in a totally false light, Evarne.
You don&#39;t seem to understand the difference&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I know Geoff is infinitely more important
than I am; but it is for his sake&mdash;that&#39;s what you won&#39;t
see and believe. But&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, <i>ma chérie</i>, it&#39;s no use arguing. There is really
nothing more to be said on the matter, so don&#39;t let the
morning milkman find us still wasting breath. It is absolutely
impossible that I can stand by and watch my cousin
run blindly into a marriage with&mdash;well&mdash;with you! I
think you really owe me some thanks for not enlightening
him immediately. The fact is, I&#39;ve always been ridiculously
yielding and considerate where you are concerned,
and the thought flashed across me yesterday that you
might prefer to choose your own method of breaking with
him. Now, what about&mdash;about that cheque, little girl?
There&#39;s no reason why you shouldn&#39;t make an excellent
marriage yet. The world is wide. They say American
men make good husbands, and I will give you my blessing
in anticipation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne remained silently musing for several minutes.
Morris augured well from this, and did not interrupt her
train of thought. At length she asked, in tones not devoid
of a slight tinge of bitterness&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
&quot;And am I expected to thank you for all your kindly
consideration?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhat to his surprise she answered quietly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. I do thank you for keeping my secret so
long, and for your offer of money, which I can well believe
you mean simply as a kindness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! And you decide...? What are you
going to do now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to marry Geoffrey Danvers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evarne!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris was decidedly taken aback by this calm yet resolute
response. Evarne rose from her knees, and sitting
down continued&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am going to become his wife, and you shall never
persuade me into telling him what I know well must cause
him such profound sorrow. Not that it would make any
lasting perceptible difference if you did betray me. You
have no idea&mdash;for <i>you</i> can have no comprehension&mdash;of how
deeply he and I love. I don&#39;t really think it lies within
your power to realise the depth&mdash;such&mdash;such sincerity of
affection. I am perfectly convinced that he would remain
true to me, despite a far worse tale than you could
tell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t really credit that romance. This attempt
to marry him with a lie upon your lips proves you to be
afraid of the effects of the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re partly right, I admit; but I do not fear that
Geoff would cease to care for me. Love is not killed so
easily&mdash;don&#39;t think it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know differently.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know absolutely nothing at all about love!
Nothing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I certainly cannot prophesy upon the delicate
topic of my cousin&#39;s affections with anything approaching
your delightful assurance. Probably he would suggest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
that he should occupy the same position towards you that
I did once, but I&#39;m quite convinced&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heaven save me from ever hearing such a proposition
from Geoff&#39;s lips. But I know he never would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As I was about to say, I am perfectly convinced that he
would never marry you&mdash;would never wish to! Good
gracious! what do you take him for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne gave a little cry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then&mdash;and then&mdash;what then? Think of the
struggle&mdash;the bitter anguish. Morris, Morris, do realise the
cruel blow it would be to him. Oh, it must be warded off!
I cannot even think of it with anything like calmness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And indeed, even as she spoke, the growing pallor upon
her cheeks supported her assertion. She rose from her
chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not have this evil deed of so-called friendship
done to him. Do you hear? You are not to tell him.
If you do, I shall deny it utterly. Do you hear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid the loudest shouting must prove as impotent
as the most persuasive of tones to drown the voice of my
conscience in this matter,&quot; declared Morris, looking unmistakably
self-righteous. Disregarding the scornful little
laugh with which this sentiment was received, he went
on&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really, Evarne, your morals are decidedly eccentric.
But you require plain speaking, don&#39;t you? Well, then,
they are absolutely infamous. Everything you say only
serves to confirm my original determination.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both his voice and his look carried conviction. Waves
of wild grief, of hopeless, crushing despair, swept over
Evarne&#39;s spirit, followed by the most intense hatred and
bitter indignation. Her caution demolished by a sense of
utter failure, she placed no restriction upon the expression
of her deep-rooted resentment against this man who had
ever been her evil genius. She stood close to him, one hand
spasmodically gripping the back of the chair from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
she had arisen, while her eyes, always brilliant, now fairly
blazed with anger and enmity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shouldn&#39;t deny it&mdash;no, indeed. But from my lips
he should learn the whole truth&mdash;the entire shameful
story. He should know how my father on his very deathbed
gave me&mdash;still a child&mdash;into the keeping of his false
friend. Surely it will be easy to realise that, when in my
hour of loss and loneliness you came professedly to help
and comfort me, I unhesitatingly entrusted myself and the
guidance of my life into your hands. Was I blameworthy
so far? But oh, what a cruel fate for any girl!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You had a very good time, my dear,&quot; interposed
Morris testily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good time!&quot; she echoed wildly. &quot;Oh! You
know, and Geoffrey shall know how, from the very
first, you systematically tricked and deceived me, lying
to me about your wife, and taking me alone with you
to Naples. Will it seem strange to him to learn that in
time you were able to make me care for you as blindly as I
trusted you? I shall tell him how you worked upon all
that was best in my nature&mdash;how you appealed to my
sympathy&mdash;how you played upon my gratitude, my affection,
to gain your own vile ends. I shall tell him all your
infamy. You cast me among absolutely depraved women&mdash;meaning
me to become as they were; for finally you bade
me sell myself for money! Yes, you would have deliberately
started me on that path which is held to be the most
degrading&mdash;the most cruel&mdash;of all the tracks that lead
hellwards. That&#39;s what you did for me, an innocent child;
and that&#39;s what you would have done, could you have had
your entire will with me! My God, how I hate you! and
the man who loves me shall hate you too. But for me he
shall feel only a new, a different, a more desperate love.
Now, then&mdash;send for him this very hour&mdash;do you think
there is any trace of doubt or fear in my heart? I defy
you absolutely&mdash;you most vile creature! Tell him&mdash;tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
him all you can, and let him judge between us. What
cause have I to fear you, or anything that such as you can
say? The life you lead, the evil you do, is repulsive in
the eyes of every decent-thinking man. You to talk of
honour&mdash;hypocrite, hypocrite!  Having ruined first my
good name, then my every happiness, when both in turn
were in your power, you come now, and under the pretence
of immovable devotion to honour, calmly propose to sweep
away everything that makes my life worth living. You
offer me money, and think I&#39;m going to creep away overwhelmed
and silenced. I have promised Geoffrey to be
ever true and loyal to him; I shall keep my word!  Send
for him immediately if you desire, and let him decide
between us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris likewise stood up before he answered. His
brows were contracted in a steady frown, yet the first
thing he did was to break into a little scornful laugh. Then
he spoke, and his voice was tense with anger.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make out as touching a legend as your imagination
can devise, yet your own lips will condemn you. Would
you not be forced to admit that you belonged to me willingly
enough until I grew tired of you? Be very sure that
after once acknowledging that single fact, the whole of
your embroideries and explanations&mdash;all your heroics&mdash;would
but fall on deaf ears. I know Geoffrey a great deal
better than you can do; you&#39;ve only seen one side of his
nature, and that, I can understand, may easily have given
you an exaggerated idea of your sway over him. Haven&#39;t
you found out yet that, honourable and straightforward
himself, he is impatient of deceit and trickery and double-dealing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She interposed with a little cry of anguish: &quot;Oh!
Morris!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Unheedingly he went on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Truthful, Geoffrey is out of sympathy with liars; good-natured
and quiet though he be, it is only safe to impose on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
him up to a certain point. You fondly hope you could melt
the anger and repulsion your confession would inevitably
create by means of easy tears and specious pleadings. I
very much doubt it. Do you think he is totally devoid
of pride and self-respect and firmness? What leads you
to suppose that he would be satisfied with soiled goods?
Do you really believe that the knowledge that he is not
first with you will merely give him a sort of sentimental
heartache&mdash;more or less violent&mdash;that will pass away once
he gets used to the notion? Do you think that he would ever
forget that every kiss of his wipes off one of mine? Do you
dare hope you would not lose all value in his estimation
once he learnt that his own cousin, for one, knows exactly
the nature of the words you speak&mdash;the look that comes
into your eyes&mdash;all your pretty little ways when you are
most deeply lost in love? Why should you think he is
devoid of the desire for exclusive possession? For my
part, knowing him and his high-flown ideals, I fancy he
could no longer endure the sight of you once he realised
what you have been&mdash;that there is no mystery about you
upon which he cannot gain enlightenment for the asking&mdash;that
however passionately he may hold you in his arms,
others have&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop, Morris! stop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words, simple in themselves, rang out wildly in
mingled entreaty and command. They were fraught with
the arresting power of a great anguish, and left behind
them a trail of dead silence, in which nerves were thrilled
and hearts beat faster.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne stood motionless for a minute, both hands
stretched out in mute appeal; then, groping her way somewhat
unsteadily to the sofa, she flung herself down, hiding
her distorted face in the cushions. But Morris had not
finished yet. He too crossed the room, and stood by the
side of the prostrate figure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall never marry my cousin&mdash;understand that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
once for all. Never! Do you think I shall submit
to see him sacrificed to the plots of a designing woman?
I advise you not to venture on another bout with me.
I can assure you I&#39;ve retained no pleasant recollections of
your temper and your impertinence. Now, I&#39;ll give
you some money, and in twenty-four hours you must
go. Surely you can see the game is up? Do you
agree?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He received no verbal answer, but the head buried in the
cushions was slightly shaken.</p>

<p class="indent">Morris found this obstinacy exasperating beyond endurance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a fool you are, Evarne!&quot; he cried roughly.
&quot;What do you want to stop for? You can&#39;t surely think
you will pull off that marriage? Do you fancy you could
make yourself out to be merely a sort of martyr&mdash;an interesting
victim? Absurd! Don&#39;t think Geoffrey would
be so dull as not to realise that in all probability I have
already had successors.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne sprang to her feet and faced him, her eyes flashing,
both her hands pressed against her breast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you had said your very worst&mdash;you merciless
monster! You, who know so well why I left Paris,
almost penniless, to starve. You do not believe your own
foul words&mdash;liar, slanderer!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put his hand firmly on her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t talk rubbish to me. Everyone knows &#39;it&#39;s
easy to take a slice from a cut loaf.&#39; If Geoffrey had not
been so ridiculously strait-laced, he too could have got
all he wanted without any of this stupid talk about marriage.
At last you&#39;ve forced me to tell you exactly what
I think of you, and I hope you&#39;re satisfied! You know
now what I should have to tell that poor boy, so had you
not better come to terms with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne clenched her teeth ferociously, and, with a low
inarticulate cry, sharply struck Morris&#39;s hand from off her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
shoulder. He made an angry gesture, but returning to
the arm-chair sat down quietly. Once more she felt that
blind fury, that strange blackness and loss of consciousness,
stealing over her mind to which she had succumbed six
years ago. But now she resisted its domination with all
her power. Had she not Geoff to remember? She pressed
her lips with such desperate violence against the ring he
had given her, that the sharp stones inflicted a tiny cut.
It was merely trifling, yet the pain served to recall her to
herself to some extent. But she neither could nor would
make any effort to guard her speech as she turned upon
her traducer. Her very voice sounded strange to her own
ears, and she herself was totally unaware of what she was
about to utter until the words had already rung out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s none of it true&mdash;you know it&#39;s not true&mdash;you know
it! You must never repeat to Geoffrey any of the abominable
things you&#39;ve said this evening. It would kill me&mdash;I
mean it&mdash;I have been hardly able to endure it alone!
I know well you have no pity. How earnestly have I appealed
to that, again and again, always vainly? You never
have mercy. But&mdash;listen! Are you not afraid of going
too far at last, of driving me to desperation? I warn you
now. You will tell such evil truth and such malicious lies
at your peril. If you do thereby succeed in separating me
and Geoff, I shall have nothing left to wish for but revenge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re getting theatrical again. Now, Evarne,
Evarne!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t trifle! I warn you, it will be wiser of you to
stay your hand. If you do finally ruin my life&mdash;if you do
thus remorselessly torture Geoff for our ill-deeds&mdash;you&#39;ll
have done the worst for me that lies within the power of
man. You will have destroyed all fear of any further
suffering that Heaven or earth could inflict. I tell you
I should be mad, and sooner or later you should be repaid.
Yes, I warn you, Lord Winborough, it will be safer for you
to avoid setting loose the devil that is in me. You guard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
my secret&mdash;that&#39;s all I ask. I&#39;ve hated you for years;
now my loathing of you is nigh as strong as is my love for
Geoff. I&#39;m not the sort of woman to be defied with impunity.
If you make me your active enemy I shall stop
at nothing. You can believe that, can&#39;t you? I would
shoot you like a dog, or stab you in the dark and glory in
it, caring less than nothing for consequences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Morris was certainly no coward, yet he quailed before
the white, menacing face, in which two blazing eyes shone
like beacon-fires, sending forth their warning of danger.
He could well believe not only that Evarne at the moment
fully meant all she said, but that she might indeed act
upon her avowed intention in the future. Inwardly cursing
the bad luck that had led him ever to become entangled
with this resolute and determined little fury, he said,
without the least outward sign of apprehension&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you are actually threatening me! You must be
mad already!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He crossed the room and took up his hat, but Evarne
barred his further progress. Flinging herself upon her
knees, she clung to the door-handle with a tenacious grip,
and made a final frantic appeal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mustn&#39;t go&mdash;Morris, you mustn&#39;t go. I shall
keep you here. You&#39;re going to Geoffrey now&mdash;I know it.
You shall not. You can&#39;t drag me away from this door,
and I shall stay here until you promise not to go to him.
Oh, you can strike me, or anything you like&mdash;I don&#39;t care,
but I shan&#39;t move. Listen, Morris&mdash;do listen to me. I
implore you&mdash;spare me. Oh, I&#39;m afraid&mdash;I&#39;m afraid of
the future and what may come. I didn&#39;t realise before
how absolutely unendurable it would be for Geoff to know.
You mustn&#39;t tell him&mdash;I&#39;d sooner die straight away&mdash;now&mdash;and
so keep my secret. Morris, Morris, think of all
I&#39;ve endured, and spare me further&mdash;spare me this&mdash;spare
Geoff&mdash;spare yourself! What can I say&mdash;what can I do?
Oh, Heaven help me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
A protracted silence ensued, in which Evarne made tremendous
mental efforts to regain complete control over
herself. She felt it to be necessary, and difficult though
the task was in such a limited space of time, she
practically succeeded. At all events she conquered
outward and apparent calm, and rose from her knees,
though still standing with her back pressed against
the door. When she spoke next it was in strangely
smooth and even tones, and with a look that was merely
questioning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me truly, Morris, do you dislike Geoff? Do you
not feel resentful because he is so much younger than you
are, and is to come after you in place of a son? No one can
possibly realise more clearly than you do what it must mean
to a man to learn about the woman he desired to marry
such a story as you have to tell about me, yet you will not
hold your peace. No law of right or justice can defend
your thus forcing Geoff to share the misery consequent
upon our past sin. You must surely have some reason
for wishing him ill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On the contrary, my chief object is to save him from
the protracted miseries of an unhappy marriage, and incidentally
to guard against his son&mdash;my future successor&mdash;being
born of an unsuitable mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see. <i>Noblesse oblige</i>. Do you mean to say that if
Geoff and I had been already married before you returned
to England, you would not have remained silent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is scarcely worth discussing an imaginary case, is
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear girl, I don&#39;t know! Possibly. Indeed, I
may even say probably. As a matter of fact, I&#39;m really
attached to the boy. If the evil had been beyond prevention
I certainly might have seen fit to keep your secret.
Even now, since my only aim is to prevent your marriage
with him, if you prefer to go away without making any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
explanation, I give you my word that he shall never know
details.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Morris, Morris, must you tell him anyhow? Is it
quite inevitable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he must be told&mdash;that is to say, the engagement
must be broken off. If you prefer to do the job yourself,
by all means let it be so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won&#39;t go to him to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will say nothing until this time to-morrow. Perhaps
you will have made up your mind to take the right course
yourself before then. I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s the limit
of what I can do for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, give me longer,&quot; she implored.</p>

<p class="indent">Her lips quivered, causing Morris to fear that this period
of calmness might not be long sustained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I&#39;ll give you two days,&quot; he agreed. &quot;But it
cannot possibly be allowed to continue longer than that.
That&#39;s forty-eight hours too long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that a promise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes. Now stand aside from the door, there&#39;s a
good girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As she obeyed silently, he stepped out into the passage.
&quot;Go to bed, <i>ma chérie</i>,&quot; he advised. &quot;Have a good
night. You&#39;ll feel better in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Impatiently she signed to him to be gone, then flung herself
into her favourite chair, rested her elbows on one of its
arms, and supported her chin on her hands. Thus she sat
motionless, gazing fixedly into vacancy with hard, dry
eyes, forgetful or regardless of Morris&#39;s presence in the open
doorway.</p>

<p class="indent">He lingered a few moments, looking with mingled feelings
at her now expressionless but perfect-featured face
and graceful form. But she neither spoke nor glanced
in his direction, and very soon the street door had closed
behind him with a final bang.</p>

<h2><a name="chXXXVIII" id="chXXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />
<small>CONFIDENCES</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Time</span> passed, and still Evarne sat motionless&mdash;thinking,
thinking. In the first dreadful minutes
of solitude she had been conscious of very
little save cruel, crushing despair, the most
abject hopelessness. Her one other clearly defined idea
had been that she must not, dare not, allow the wild paroxysm
of anguish that was rending her brain, to get the
mastery over her will-power. Fiercely resolved not to
lose self-control even for a moment, she forced herself to
sit calm and motionless, to drive back tears, to stifle sobs,
groans, cries. And in time this resolutely simulated composure
became very nearly genuine. Gradually she found
herself growing able to think rationally, not desperately.
Thus there was some chance for a practical idea&mdash;an inspiration&mdash;to
evolve itself from out the rapid progression
of her thoughts.</p>

<p class="indent">She was possessed of a quiet obstinacy that would not&mdash;that
could not&mdash;acknowledge final defeat so long as
the most shadowy possibility of ultimate success remained.
The feeblest glimmer of hope was sufficient to support her
courage, her energies. Now, although the end appeared
to be so near, although she was faced by obstacles that
certainly looked insurmountable, she could not bring
herself to submit with meekness and resignation to what so
surely seemed to be written in her fate.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus, still rebellious, she sat thinking, thinking. But
no plan of possible action occurred to her mind. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
could be done in two days to still a man&#39;s tongue, when
prayers and entreaties and threats had all alike failed absolutely?
The only method yet untried was that of bribery,
and there she was a bankrupt. She had nothing to offer&mdash;absolutely
no inducement to hold out.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly but surely the conviction forced itself upon her
calmer reflection that she could indeed do no more; that
she was hopelessly in Morris&#39;s power. She felt herself
enveloped by a fresh access of despair. What a dire misfortune&mdash;what
a fearsome calamity&mdash;that he should have
come upon the scene just at this crisis. He had declared
almost with certainty that had he found her already his
cousin&#39;s wife he would have held his peace. Why, oh why,
had he not been kept out of her path for two short months
longer&mdash;just until she was indeed safely married?</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she started to her feet, her eyes glistening,
her expression eager and alert. At length a light shone in
the dense gloom&mdash;in the tangled jungle a path had been
found.</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment Philia was heard opening the street door.
The old woman made straight for the sitting-room, declaring
as she came&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Edie Gordon didn&#39;t know what pattern&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The words died on her lips as she beheld Evarne.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My gosh, whatever made yer dress up pretty like that,
to spend the evenin&#39; alone?&quot; Then she added in a tone
of sudden suspicion: &quot;Seems to me there&#39;s somethin&#39;
goin&#39; on in this &#39;ere &#39;ouse what I don&#39;t know of! What
&#39;ave I bin and done, to be kept in the dark about everythin&#39;
like this for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shan&#39;t be any longer, Philia. After your supper
I&#39;m going to tell you everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll buck up, then. &#39;A full stummick maketh a wise
&#39;ead and a kind &#39;eart&#39;&mdash;Shakespeare.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Ere long she had finished her meal, and was ensconced
in the arm-chair. Evarne drew up a footstool and sat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
down, resting against the old woman&#39;s knee. But she
remained without speaking. Once or twice she half
started upon her task, but the words died on her lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Philia at length broke the silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dearie, I&#39;m almost old enough to be your grandmother,
but for all that we&#39;re jist real pals, ain&#39;t we? Remember,
pals can always trust each other, and nothin&#39; ever makes
any real difference between &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus encouraged, Evarne took the plunge and told the
story of her life. When she had finished, she asked pleadingly&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mind? You&#39;re not very disappointed in
me, are you, Philia? I did care for him, really and truly I
did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes were downcast, the tone of her voice was full
of anxiety. The old woman&#39;s response took the form of a
query.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do yer expect me to say to yer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne shook her head somewhat hopelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t yer look me straight in the face? I can&#39;t answer
proper-like if yer won&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne&#39;s mind was far too entirely taken up with deeper
thoughts, with future schemes, for her to be really overweighed
with embarrassment before Philia. Without any
effort she raised her head instantly. The necessity of an
upturned face for an answer was then made clear. The
old woman bent forward and kissed her straight on the lips&mdash;a
noisy, unabashed kiss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I might think badly of some gals, Evarne, but you&mdash;why,
no matter who was to tell me yer was a bad lot, I&#39;d
say &#39;Beggin&#39; yer pardin&#39;, I knows &#39;er too well! She&#39;s
real good!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne threw her arms impulsively around her old
friend&#39;s neck, and murmured her thanks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But listen,&quot; she continued, settling herself down again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
upon the footstool. &quot;What I&#39;ve told you is only the cause
of my present trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But almost in the same instant Philia had exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My gosh, what about Mr. Danvers?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s it&mdash;that&#39;s it! I haven&#39;t told him, and I never
mean to, never, never!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And yer&#39;d be a regular fool if yer did,&quot; declared this
worldly-minded counsellor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But&mdash;oh, it&#39;s too dreadful; it&#39;s too horrid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, hush! Don&#39;t git excited.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne waited a minute, then went on quietly enough to
relate the whole of her doubts and anxieties.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At first I was in despair, as you may imagine,&quot; she
concluded; &quot;but now I&#39;ve got a fresh idea in my mind,
and I want your help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philia rubbed her hands together with evident satisfaction.
She had flung herself whole-heartedly on her pal&#39;s
side in this affair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If we do succeed,&quot; went on Evarne, &quot;I shall owe all
my happiness to you, and so will Geoffrey, though he won&#39;t
know it. I shall be grateful to you for ever and ever, and
I shall look after you all your life, Philia. Now, listen
carefully. Morris said that if he had found me already his
cousin&#39;s wife&mdash;if our marriage had been an accomplished
fact&mdash;then&mdash;very likely&mdash;he would of his own accord have
remained silent forever concerning what he knows. He
entirely repudiated the idea that his determination to
betray me is prompted by any spite or hatred. As it is, he
has promised to hold his peace until Wednesday evening.
Very well, before that time I mean to be Geoffrey&#39;s wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness gracious to me, what a notion!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s absolutely my last resource. It&#39;s my one chance;
my only hope. I shall persuade Geoff to take me abroad
immediately, so that Morris cannot straightway tell him my
secret in a sudden outburst of rage. If he writes, I shall
see that Geoff doesn&#39;t get the letter. Oh, I know it&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
leading me through vile deceitful tracks, but having started,
I must go on. But I wish I&#39;d never started, Philia. That&#39;s
Heaven&#39;s truth. I wish I&#39;d never started! Ah, well!
Besides&mdash;once I am Geoffrey&#39;s wife, the keeping of this
secret becomes a matter of life or death to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if the snake chose to tell after yer was safely
married, &#39;e couldn&#39;t do no &#39;arm then, could &#39;e?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No harm? Oh, Philia! If Geoffrey once reproached
me for entrapping him&mdash;if I heard him regret his marriage&mdash;if
he ever expressed half a wish that he could be free again,
then, why then, there would be but one course open to me.
I should kill myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Philia started.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t talk of sich a thing,&quot; she almost wailed; &quot;don&#39;t
plan it in cold blood like that. It&#39;s mad and wicked.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who says it&#39;s wicked?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, everybody knows it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;There&#39;s nothing either good or bad, but thinking
makes it so.&#39; Did you ever hear that before? &#39;Everybody
knows,&#39; forsooth! Oh, Philia, how can you be so
blind! Surely it&#39;s perfectly obvious that it would be the
one and only right course. As far as honour goes I should
have no choice. Don&#39;t you believe it&#39;s necessarily wicked
to kill one&#39;s self. Sometimes the weak&mdash;the cowardly&mdash;the
really despicable thing to do is to cling to life. Oh, I&#39;m
beginning to hate myself&mdash;I&#39;m being dragged through the
mud and grimed almost beyond my own recognition.
There, don&#39;t look at me like that. But you mustn&#39;t think
I&#39;m so infamous as to be planning to use Geoff&#39;s blind love&mdash;his
noble, unquestioning trust in me&mdash;as the very means
by which to fetter him in bonds that would remain unbreakable,
even though they might suddenly become repulsive
to him. It is because power lies in these hands of mine&mdash;soft
and slender though they are&mdash;see them,&quot; and as she
held them out and eyed them askance, they shook like
aspen leaves. &quot;It is because I can cut asunder all earthly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
ties between us, and set him free, that I dare expose him
to the risk. It&#39;s no use, Philia. I can&#39;t love in a sane,
temperate, moderate sort of manner&mdash;I can&#39;t do it, I tell
you! I love Geoff so much more than myself&mdash;so infinitely
much more&mdash;that life or death for me seems scarcely worth
a thought.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">No words came to the old woman; not even Shakespeare
was able to suggest to her any comfort for this trembling
girl, gliding so swiftly and surely into deceit and
sin.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I needn&#39;t have told you of what I intend to do in the
event of Morris&#39;s betraying me after my marriage, though
I shall tell him,&quot; Evarne went on; &quot;but I&mdash;I&mdash;couldn&#39;t
bear that you should misjudge me, dear. It would be
dreadful to me to think that you believed I was merely
planning all this from an unscrupulous desire to make my
own position secure at all costs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As if I&#39;d think anything of the sort!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, if you did, I for one couldn&#39;t blame you. I
know it must look like it. Oh, Philia, I&#39;m miserable at
what I&#39;m doing,&quot; Evarne cried, knitting her white brow.
&quot;If anyone had told me a week ago that I should sink to
deliberate scheming to make Geoff marry me quickly, and
that I was seriously proposing to watch his correspondence,
I should&mdash;there, I am mad, perhaps! I could almost wish
to believe it. There is no truth, no honour in me! Oh,
Philia, Philia, how I hope my dead father cannot see what
I am doing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shuddered, and buried her face convulsively in her
friend&#39;s lap. The old woman, full of pity, passed her hand
over the thick locks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Make up yer mind once and for all, my pet. Think
about it well. Don&#39;t go and do what yer will be sorry for.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The head was lifted immediately, defiantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I know what I am going to do. I have done with
thinking. I am going to marry Geoff.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
&quot;But &#39;ow are yer goin&#39; to work the trick, so sudden like,
without &#39;im wonderin&#39; what&#39;s in yer mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s where you&#39;ve got to help me. I don&#39;t see quite
how to do it alone. With your aid it will be wickedly easy
for me to&mdash;to deceive him, because he trusts me so entirely.
Ah well! Now listen to my plan....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tired of her low seat, she drew up a chair close to
Philia.</p>

<p class="indent">Long they sat into the night, arranging, discussing, even
rehearsing what was to be done on the morrow. At
length they separated, but slumber was not for Evarne.
No sooner had she laid her weary head upon the pillow than
there came to her from the distance the steady throb,
throb of machinery.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What can that be?&quot; she mused fretfully. &quot;There&#39;s
no factory about here, and if there were, why should it be
working in the middle of the night?&quot; She rose up on her
elbow to listen; the sound ceased. Once more she sought
repose; the steady, distant beating recommenced. &quot;I
couldn&#39;t sleep at the best of times through that persistent
noise,&quot; she sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she seemed to hear cautious footsteps within her
room. For a moment every muscle of her body contracted
with terror, and the thud of the distant engines increased in
volume tenfold. Starting up, she struck a match. The
room was empty. As she lay down once more she realised
the meaning of all these strange, inexplicable sounds.
Those steps, that dull, steady throbbing, all originated
within her own tortured brain.</p>

<p class="indent">Repeatedly through that night of wakefulness she could
have believed she heard movements, even whispers, within
the room. She lay on the borderland of slumber, against
her will composing endless appeals to Geoff, begging for
mercy, for forgiveness, for continued love, going over and
over the pleas she might have uttered to Morris but had
neglected.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
&quot;If I could sleep&mdash;oh, if I could only sleep!&quot; she cried
wearily.</p>

<p class="indent">But the day broke without her having won oblivion
for a single minute.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXXXIX" id="chXXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />
<small>EVIL, THAT GOOD MAY COME</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> morning dawned radiantly clear, and hot to
sultriness. Evarne dressed leisurely, and by
nine o&#39;clock, far from being at the studio, was
still toying with her breakfast. Her magnificent
health saved her from looking as exhausted as the sleepless
night and the nerve-strain of the last few days would well
have justified. Indeed, with a hectic flush upon her cheek,
and eyes supernaturally brilliant, any untrained observer
would have adjudged her a fit model for the goddess Hygeia
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do try and eat somethin&#39;,&quot; persuaded Philia anxiously.
&quot;Goodness knows when you last &#39;ad a decent square meal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t feel that I can, and what&#39;s more, I can&#39;t stop
looking at it any longer,&quot; declared the girl as she rose from
the table. &quot;Those poor young men will be thinking I&#39;m
not coming again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And indeed at the studio everything did seem to be
thoroughly disorganised.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we have done a fine lot of work these last few
days,&quot; remarked Jack disconsolately.</p>

<p class="indent">But Pallister was in high spirits. He had seen Maudie
Meridith on the previous evening, and, moved by his
earnest reproaches, she had undertaken to do her level best
to come this very morning to give him a first sitting for
her portrait. Thus he answered Jack&#39;s complaining growl
with light-hearted <i>insouciance</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well, we can&#39;t all keep our noses eternally to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
grindstone like you do, old chap. I think we&#39;re getting
along splendidly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Jack was not to be thus pacified.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want to waste this morning. Do you think Miss
Stornway will be coming, Geoff?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely,&quot; rejoined that young man, turning from the
open window from whence he had been watching the
passers-by in the street below. &quot;She would have sent a
message, as she did yesterday, if she still felt too unwell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And in a very few minutes his faith was justified; Evarne
appeared at the farther end of the street. He watched her
as she drew near, noting how she showed graceful and
dignified amid the crowd. Although the studio was on the
third floor, the summer air was so clear that, as she drew
nearer, he could see her features quite distinctly. Some
attraction drew her gaze upwards, and she waved her hand
in greeting, whereupon he ran downstairs and met her at
the garden gate.</p>

<p class="indent">Her dress fitted exquisitely over her lovely figure; it
was of pink cambric, made according to her individual
fancy in costume. Its rich hue emphasised her dark
eyes and flawless complexion as none other could have
done, while her simple straw hat was wreathed with blush
roses. Geoff had never yet beheld her clad from head to
foot in shades of pink, and thus arrayed, apart from all
question of personal affection, she must have been a sheer
delight to any artist&#39;s eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m dreadfully late,&quot; she said apologetically
to Jack and Pallister on gaining the studio. &quot;Please
forgive me, and you shall just see how quickly I can get
into those Greek robes when I like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must sit down first and have a rest after your
walk,&quot; insisted Geoff, while Pallister declared gaily&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t trouble about me. You&#39;re going to have a rival
this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A rival! This is very serious.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
&quot;Such a pretty one too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Really? Who is she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha, ha! You&#39;ll see when she comes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He jumped down from the studio flight of steps on which
he had been perched, skipped gaily across the floor, and
leant perilously far out of the low window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How excited that baby is,&quot; said Geoff, smiling indulgently.
&quot;He expects Miss Meridith to give him a sitting
to-day. Now, come here, sit down by me and rest. Could
you eat some of those cherries?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne consented to try, and took her seat on the divan
beside Geoff, the plate on her lap. Pallister glanced at the
little group.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Jack,&quot; declared the wise youth, &quot;guess we&#39;re
not exactly indispensable to the consumption of those
cherries. Come down to the garden and let&#39;s have a smoke
till Maudie arrives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was thinking of sketching Geoff and Miss Stornway as
they sat together there,&quot; said Jack simply. But since
Pallister received this proposition with a hearty burst of
laughter, he meekly wended his way downstairs, still complaining
under his breath at the valuable hours he was
losing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re sure you feel quite well again?&quot; demanded
Geoff for about the fifth time, reading Evarne&#39;s face with
an anxious, not over-satisfied glance. &quot;You don&#39;t look
quite the same as usual somehow, sweetest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re fanciful,&quot; and the bright eyes were flashed upon
him reassuringly. &quot;I&#39;m quite well and strong, and ready
to face the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s good hearing. You&#39;d laugh at me if you knew
how I&#39;ve been worrying about you. I vow I lay awake
half the night thinking of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be so proud about it, for I did exactly the same
thing for you. At least, to be exact, I sat up talking to old
Philia about Geoff and all his faults and virtues. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
really is a good old soul, and has taken quite a fancy to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And since it seems that her presence in your little home
is essential to my being allowed there, I have, perforce,
taken quite a liking to her. Good thing it&#39;s a mutual
affection, eh?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t it indeed? Well, to-night sees the end of her
sittings, so you will be able to come quite often if you care
to. To start with, I herewith formally invite you to supper
to-morrow night. Miss Evarne Stornway requests the
pleasure of Mr. Geoffrey Danvers&#39; company at supper
to-morrow night, at seven-thirty. R.S.V.P.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Danvers has much pleasure in accepting Miss
Stornway&#39;s kind invitation for Tuesday evening,&quot; returned
Geoff with mock solemnity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right!&quot; laughed Evarne, clapping her hands together
gleefully. &quot;You shall come out into the kitchen and help
me make pancakes. I&#39;m really quite adorable then. You
will just love me when you see me making pancakes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She tossed back her head and dangled a cherry into her
open mouth. Geoff&#39;s reply was interrupted by the sound
of stumbling footsteps mounting the stairs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Talking of angels,&quot; cried Evarne, as a panting figure
leaned against the doorway. &quot;Why, Philia, what do you
want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;excuse my intrudin&#39;,&quot; commenced the old woman.
&quot;Two young gentlemen sittin&#39; in the garden told me to
come right up, and I should find the studio at the top of
the stairs, and the door standin&#39; open. I couldn&#39;t lose me
way if I tried, they said; and sure enough I&#39;m &#39;ere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then come in and sit down, Mrs. Harbert,&quot; said Geoff.
&quot;I hope nothing&#39;s the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m quite well, thankin&#39; you, sir, and the same to you.
I wanted to consult Evarne on a matter of great himportance.
I&#39;ve got to decide in a &#39;urry, or I wouldn&#39;t &#39;ave
hintruded.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
&quot;Well, here is Evarne. I&#39;ll leave you for a while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t go, Geoff,&quot; said the girl, laying her hand on his
arm. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose it&#39;s any great and wondrous
secret, is it, Philia?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a bit of it. Jist after you&#39;d gorn comes a letter
for me from that very nice gentleman, Mr. Topham&mdash;the
same as I sat for six months ago as the Countess o&#39; Suffolk,
saying as &#39;ow she wouldn&#39;t &#39;ave &#39;er &#39;ead cut off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, now&mdash;well. What do you think? You&#39;d never
guess! &#39;E wants me to go to Scotland for two &#39;ole months
to pose for &#39;im out of doors all among the gorse and &#39;eather
and &#39;eath! It&#39;s a bit o&#39; kindness on Mr. Topham&#39;s part,
for I s&#39;pose there&#39;s elderly ladies in Scotland &#39;e could paint,
but &#39;e allus was good to me. I&#39;m to telegraph me answer
and go on Thursday mornin&#39;. I&#39;d like to go ever so much&mdash;wouldn&#39;t
I jist, my gosh!&mdash;but I&#39;m worryin&#39; about &#39;ow
you&#39;d git on without me, Evarne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you ought not to miss such a splendid offer. Let
me see the letter, may I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After glancing through its contents the girl handed it
back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She really ought to go, Geoff, oughtn&#39;t she? Mr.
Topham offers very generous terms, including the fare both
ways. She needs a change. Don&#39;t you, Philia? It will
be splendid for you to get out of London this hot weather.
I only wish a holiday could be managed for poor little
Evarne. Yes, I decide for you&mdash;you must accept.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all very fine for me,&quot; demurred the old woman;
&quot;but what about you, left all alone in the &#39;ouse?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, indeed!&quot; demanded Geoff. &quot;What will you
do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s jist what I was wonderin&#39; as I came along &#39;ere,&quot;
declared Philia. &quot;Comin&#39; &#39;ome tired as she does, &#39;ardly
able to stand sometimes&mdash;pore child&mdash;and not a soul there
to say a word to &#39;er, or git &#39;er so much as a cup o&#39; tea!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
I&#39;m afraid I ought to tell Mr. Topham as &#39;ow I can&#39;t come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne did not answer for a few seconds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does sound a touching picture, certainly. You make
me quite sorry for myself,&quot; she confessed. Then with a
sudden forced renewal of brightness: &quot;But there, it can&#39;t
be helped. Any number of models live alone always.
Of course Philia must go to Scotland, and I mustn&#39;t be
selfish and lazy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It ain&#39;t a question of bein&#39; jist selfish and lazy,&quot; rejoined
the old woman rather testily. &quot;I ain&#39;t sure it
would be right of me to go gallawantin&#39; jist now. &#39;Twould
be different if yer was quite well and strong. But I ask yer
to answer honest. Ain&#39;t this &#39;ot weather upsettin&#39; yer?
Ain&#39;t yer bein&#39; overworked or somethin&#39;? She &#39;arf fainted
again last night, sir. She ain&#39;t so strong by &#39;alf as she likes
to make out. I didn&#39;t ought to go, I knows it, though I do
want to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evarne, you told me you felt better,&quot; cried Geoff in
mingled reproach and alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I am this morning,&quot; she rejoined, smiling at him.
&quot;Now, you run off home, Philia, and think about packing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the old woman shook her head, lingered and looked
at Geoff with eyes full of doubt and anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think I ought to leave &#39;er lonely, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was decidedly uneasy at the idea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t like the notion&mdash;really I don&#39;t. Look here,
can&#39;t you get a servant?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne smiled again, this time somewhat ruefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He does think we&#39;re rich, doesn&#39;t he, Philia? Dear
Geoff, to speak frankly, I can&#39;t afford it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He put his hand on her arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darling, surely you will let me see to that for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head with unhesitating decision.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn&#39;t possibly let you ever give me money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At length Philia saw an opening, and no alert lawyer
could have darted at it more promptly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
&quot;Until &#39;e is yer &#39;usband, yer mean. Then he&#39;ll &#39;ave a
right to, won&#39;t &#39;e?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, everything will be different then,&quot; she assented,
with a swift, shy glance at her lover.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, you dear little silly,&quot; he rejoined tenderly, &quot;it&#39;s
only a question of two or three weeks at the very outside.
What real difference can it possibly make?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does&mdash;I feel it does. Please don&#39;t press the point.
Now, Geoff, remember I&#39;m always right. You owned that
yesterday evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and what did I tell you? Have you forgotten?
That you would have to marry me all the sooner on account
of this terrible correctness. Now, then, how much sooner
does this fresh example bring it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here Mrs. Harbert chipped in again, desperately seizing
the bull by the horns.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s a real pity yer &#39;aven&#39;t bin engaged a week or two
longer, both of yer. Then I&#39;d say, git married at once&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;to-day,
and let Evarne &#39;ave a &#39;usband to look
after &#39;er &#39;enceforward.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff&#39;s eyes brightened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he was commencing, but Evarne interrupted
in tones of obvious annoyance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought not to say things like that, Philia. It&#39;s
very inconsiderate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the culprit was in no ways disconcerted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lor, she&#39;s a regular babby,&quot; she declared laughing.
&quot;The very idea o&#39; really gettin&#39; spliced makes &#39;er that
bashful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And sure enough the colour on Evarne&#39;s cheeks had
perceptibly deepened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jist look if she ain&#39;t gorn as red as a radish,&quot; continued
Mrs. Harbert. &quot;And all along o&#39; the idea of a
weddin&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; declared Evarne with energy; &quot;it
was your silly suggestion of getting married at once&mdash;without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
any delay&mdash;that vexed me. You oughtn&#39;t to say
things of that sort. You&#39;re excited about this Scotch
tour, you stupid old Philia. As if people ever rushed off
and got married at twenty-four hours&#39; notice! And for no
better reason than that I run the risk of feeling lonely and
unhappy in an empty house. Bless the darling, she shan&#39;t
have any of the hardships of life&mdash;no, she shan&#39;t! You&#39;ve
got no right to mortify me so; it&#39;s horrid of you, I&#39;m really
vexed with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She moved away, and sat down with her back to Philia,
tapping the floor angrily with the tip of her pretty pink
shoe. The old woman shrugged her shoulders and appealed
to Geoff in decidedly nettled tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Danvers, sir, am I a fool or is she? One of us is,
that&#39;s certain, and though I asks yer which it is, I knows
without bein&#39; told. Maybe I &#39;ave taken liberties. I was
only jokin&#39;. Still, it&#39;s unkind o&#39; Evarne to talk to me like
that, ain&#39;t it? I&#39;d better make up me mind not to go
away, and &#39;ave done with all talk. &#39;Lonely and un&#39;appy!&#39;
Why, it might be the death of &#39;er&mdash;that&#39;s what it might
be. Yes, my beauty, you&#39;ve chucked yerself downstairs
in a faint once in yer life. You&#39;ll be doin&#39; it again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne glanced over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rubbish! I was ill then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So yer are now; what&#39;s the good o&#39; denyin&#39; it?
You&#39;ll take a header over the banisters one fine evenin&#39;
and cut yer &#39;ead open on the floor, and it will bleed and
bleed and bleed, and no one will know. You&#39;ll lie there
all night, and in the mornin&#39; you&#39;ll be dead&mdash;a corpse&mdash;d&#39;you
hear?&mdash;cold and stiff&mdash;and all the howlin&#39; in the
world won&#39;t make yer alive agin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne laughed at this lurid visionary tableau, and
recovered her temper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what a very vivid imagination&mdash;&mdash;&quot; she was
commencing.</p>

<p class="indent">But Geoff interrupted. He had been rapidly turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span>
over in his mind this startling idea of an immediate wedding,
and found it rose-coloured. Not only did he long for the
day that should give him the woman he loved, but he foresaw
that, by his marriage being once put beyond the pale
of argument, he would probably avoid a great deal of useless
discussion and consequent ill-feeling between himself
and his cousin. Except Winborough, he had no relations
sufficiently near to feel themselves aggrieved at not having
been confided in about the matter&mdash;and indeed when
were aunts or cousins ever seriously considered in such a
case? The one objection to this unconventional suddenness
was that it might be more pleasant for Evarne not to
have had her wedding in any way apparently hurried
or peculiar. But now other circumstances seemed to
counter-balance this really very small and indefinite
objection.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus his meditations were not long protracted, and he
interrupted Evarne&#39;s sentence upon sudden impulse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Harbert is quite right. It would not be at all safe
for you to be living absolutely alone while you&#39;re liable to
these horrible fainting attacks. Dearest&mdash;dearest&mdash;marry
me to-morrow and give me the right to really look after
you and care for you. Please don&#39;t shake your head.
Obviously it is in every way best and advisable. Why do
you hesitate? We don&#39;t want a smart wedding or anything
alarming of that sort, do we? You do care for me,
really and truly, don&#39;t you, and you believe that you will
be safe and happy with me? Mrs. Harbert, you&#39;ve had
a really brilliant idea&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lor, sir, I only spoke in fun. I never thought of your
takin&#39; it serious-like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you see now, don&#39;t you&mdash;don&#39;t you, Evarne&mdash;that
to procure a special licence and get married to-morrow
morning, without any unnecessary preparation, will save a
world of annoyance and anxiety? My dear one, do think
how I should worry about you. Besides&mdash;besides&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
truth is, I want to feel that you are mine beyond the possibility
of your changing your mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think I might, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t mean that exactly. There, I don&#39;t want
to have to think about it at all; I want to make our
marriage a fact. I want to be secure of you. Our circumstances
are somewhat peculiar. We have neither of
us got any relations we need to think of; we&#39;ve only got
each other in the whole world, Evarne. Why should we
run any risks? Dear one, dear love, be persuaded. Say
&#39;yes,&#39; and you shall never, never regret it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He spoke in tones soft and coaxing enough to melt a
heart of stone, yet he received no answer, either by word or
look. Somewhat puzzled, Philia broke the protracted
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yer can&#39;t love &#39;im as much as yer told me, or you&#39;d be
&#39;appy at the idea of callin&#39; &#39;im &#39;usband.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Evarne heeded her not. She was overwhelmed with
shame at the ease with which her own plot had succeeded.
Where she was concerned, Geoff was absolutely devoid of
the faintest suspicions of any description. The bare
possibility of trickery, of prearrangement or of falsehood
having any part in Philia&#39;s unexpected visit to the studio,
obviously never entered his mind. It was enough to him
to be made to see that his &#39;Sweet Lady&#39;s&#39; material well-being
would be benefited by her becoming his wife at once,
and immediately his whole desire was to persuade her
to this course of action. Knowing that practically every
word she had spoken that morning had been uttered with
the full intention of deceiving&mdash;as part of a deliberate
scheme&mdash;the perfect confidence he had in her integrity and
honour, his loyal, generous, and complete trust, were to
her a bitter reproach. It stabbed her conscience, and she
stood silent and abashed before him.</p>

<p class="indent">But far was it from her thoughts to waver in her purpose
at this eleventh hour. Raising her head, she looked for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
minute full into Geoff&#39;s earnest grey eyes, and within her
heart she again registered a vow to put his happiness, his
welfare, first and foremost now and in the future. These
minutes of apparent hesitation were sacred, and her expression
was intense and solemn as she replied in a slightly
quivering voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My own beloved, I am yours, absolutely and without
restriction. You are to decide my life, my actions; to
guide my very thoughts as is most pleasing to you. Everything
shall be done exactly as you desire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Entirely oblivious of Mrs. Harbert&#39;s presence he thanked
her by kisses.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll telegraph to Mr. Topham, then,&quot; interposed the
overlooked Philia after a minute. &quot;I&#39;ll tell &#39;im I&#39;m comin&#39;
right enough. Now, &#39;owever will I find out what train
to git or what station to go from, or anything else?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne came back to earth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask Geoff to look it up in the time-table for you,&quot; she
suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Where is it you want to go to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Saint&mdash;Saint&mdash;it&#39;s Saint somewhere,&quot; and Philia again
peered into her letter. &quot;St. Andrews.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the young man left the studio to find the time-table,
she came close to Evarne, a broad smile of triumph on her
genial countenance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, now, ain&#39;t I bin and gorn and done well? Ain&#39;t I
a fine hactress? Didn&#39;t the stage lose a shinin&#39; light when
I took up Hart as a profession? Ain&#39;t I got a fine invention
too? Didn&#39;t I ought to &#39;ave written books? Ain&#39;t
I been wonderful sharp? Pity I ain&#39;t a beastly lawyer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne seized both the old woman&#39;s hands in a somewhat
frantic grip.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear, I shall never forget what you&#39;ve done for
me. I&#39;m saved. Thank God&mdash;thank God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep quiet, duckie. It&#39;s not quite done yet. You&#39;ve
got to prevent &#39;im from tellin&#39; the snake till after it&#39;s over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
&quot;I know, but Heaven is on my side.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a few moments Geoff returned with a slip of paper in
his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See here, I&#39;ve written down times and station, so you&#39;ll
have no difficulty. We must go away for a honeymoon,
mustn&#39;t we, Evarne?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course. I shouldn&#39;t feel that I&#39;d been legally
married without that,&quot; she declared promptly and gladly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll help her pack, then, and look after her generally,
won&#39;t you, Mrs. Harbert? Do you know of anything she
wants? If so, tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There&#39;s nothin&#39; as I knows of as won&#39;t wait until
Thursday, when yer can git it for &#39;er yerself,&quot; declared
Philia.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please don&#39;t talk about me as if I wasn&#39;t present,&quot;
remonstrated Evarne. &quot;You run away now, Philia. By
the way, Geoff, you must come to supper with me to-night.
It will be the last real opportunity I shall have of playing
genuine hostess to you. Think of that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He naturally agreed, whereupon Evarne and Philia
indulged in a brief whispered debate concerning the <i>menu</i>
for the evening meal. At length the old dame took her
departure, thoroughly well satisfied with her own hitherto
unsuspected cleverness.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXL" id="chXL"></a>CHAPTER XL<br />
<small>A FRESH COMPLICATION</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Immediately</span> they were alone Geoff seized Evarne
by both hands, and holding her at arm&#39;s length,
surveyed her from head to foot, as if for the first
time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evarne, Evarne! to think that by to-morrow evening
you will be my wife! Can you realise it? I hardly can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m not going to try,&quot; she asserted. &quot;It doesn&#39;t
do to make too certain of anything in this world. Perhaps
we shan&#39;t be able to get a special licence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s quite simple. A friend of mine was married
by that means. We have to make solemn affidavits that
there is no legal impediment. Then it is essential that the
ceremony shall take place in the parish where one of us has
lived for a certain length of time. You won&#39;t mind being
married in church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides getting the licence, then, all we have to do is
to arrange with a clergyman, and there need not be an
hour&#39;s delay. It&#39;s not even necessary to heed the canonical
hours. I&#39;d better go down to Doctors Commons
almost immediately and see about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Just then a girl&#39;s bright laugh fell upon their ears, footsteps
were heard mounting the stairs, and in a minute
Maudie Meridith, Jack and Pallister entered the studio.
The little lady, though somewhat breathless, was in high
spirits. She evidently looked upon this visit quite in the
light of an adventure.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg&nbsp;339]</span>
&quot;Only fancy my getting here safe and sound, Mr. Danvers!&quot;
she exclaimed in her gay voice. &quot;It&#39;s just like a
novelette, isn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pallister speedily introduced the two young women to
one another. Although it was tacitly recognised that
Geoff&#39;s engagement was not to be made public knowledge
just yet, Pallister had not been able to resist the temptation
of relating to Maudie the events that had arisen from Winborough&#39;s
visit to the studio on Monday afternoon. She
therefore gazed with the keenest interest upon the beautiful
model who was one day to become a countess, and greeted
her with the utmost cordiality and sweetness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you find it awfully difficult to escape by yourself?&quot;
inquired Pallister, stumbling over the stand of his easel
as he rushed about making final preparations.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was fairly simple. I was so frightened at breakfast,
for auntie suddenly announced she was going out
somewhere or other&mdash;anyhow, she suggested that I should
go with her. I was dreadfully upset, for I couldn&#39;t think
of any reasonable excuse for refusing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But an idea came at last?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fortunately there was no need. Auntie, who was
opening her letters, came to one from Madame Constantia,
her dressmaker, saying she should call this morning. So
I was able to slip away easily&mdash;lucky, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Rather! Now let&#39;s pose you for this wondrous
picture.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After many different attempts, he turned to his friends
with a satisfied air: &quot;I think that&#39;s perfect. What do
you say, you others?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Public opinion decided that the model&#39;s left arm had
better be placed negligently over the arm of the chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, that&#39;s a great improvement,&quot; confessed the artist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It can&#39;t possibly be altered for the better, I&#39;m sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How am I to pose my eyes?&quot; inquired the docile
model.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter at present. Now, keep quite
still.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Holding a stick of charcoal at arm&#39;s-length, Pallister
unconsciously put on a stern and impressive frown as he
commenced to put leading lines upon his big new canvas.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff and Evarne once again sat down side by side on
the divan, and in low tones proceeded to discuss the prosaic
business arrangements for the eventful morrow.
Evarne did not disguise her anxiety to leave England
immediately on the completion of the wedding ceremony,
and thus Geoff had now to make arrangements for the
journey, find out times of trains and boats, take tickets and
telegraph to hotels, as well as procure the licence and arrange
with a clergyman.</p>

<p class="indent">The discussion of the many details that had to be considered
occupied some time, and at length the silence of
the room, broken only by the indistinct murmurs of this
inaudible conversation, became boring in the extreme to
Miss Maudie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish I could see you working as I sit, Frankie; but
of course that isn&#39;t possible,&quot; she said somewhat plaintively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid not,&quot; agreed Pallister. &quot;But you must
have plenty of rests, and then you can see how I&#39;m getting
on, though you know it&#39;s never very pleasant to show work
in its early stages to any but a fellow-artist.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But won&#39;t you do better than ever, knowing that I&#39;m
going to look at it? Am I not an inspiration?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course you are, but you&#39;ll see yourself looking like
a nightmare, with black eyes and yellow cheeks and so
on. But don&#39;t worry about that. It&#39;s only at first. I
feel that in the end I&#39;m going to make this a veritable
masterpiece.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After a very few more minutes&#39; silence she spoke again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What fun this is! I&#39;m not really tired yet, and I&#39;ve
been sitting a long time already, haven&#39;t I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg&nbsp;341]</span>
&quot;Oh Maudie, hardly that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, haven&#39;t I? Dear me, I thought I had.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t wriggle your head, there&#39;s an angel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was I wriggling?&quot; inquired the victim. &quot;I&#39;m so
sorry; my neck felt stiff.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must have a rest, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh no, thank you. It doesn&#39;t matter. I can bear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the tones of resignation were too touching. Pallister
laid down his brushes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along. Don&#39;t let yourself get thoroughly tired,
or you&#39;ll not want to come again. Besides, models sometimes
faint if they have to go on posing after they are tired
out. You ask Miss Stornway if you don&#39;t believe me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne corroborated Pallister&#39;s assertion, though in her
heart she did not think there was much danger of Maudie
collapsing yet awhile. Nevertheless the girl gladly descended
from the throne, and almost instantly her glance
fell upon the diamond ring sparkling upon Evarne&#39;s hand.</p>

<p class="indent">There seems something particularly attractive to &quot;Sweet
Seventeen&quot; about engagement rings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Miss Stornway,&quot; she cried, &quot;do let me look at
your ring. What a perfect beauty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was pleased by this admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to see it in the sunshine,&quot; she declared.
&quot;It is too lovely for words then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She rose from the divan, and crossed over towards the
window. Standing in the full flood of golden August sunlight,
she held out her hand for Maudie&#39;s continued inspection.
For a time she too revelled in the rainbow-hued
scintillations of the diamonds, but after a few moments her
glance strayed casually down the street. Immediately
she broke in upon the girl&#39;s rapturous comments with a
strangled little cry of mingled dismay and surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot; demanded Geoff, rising quickly to his
feet.</p>

<p class="indent">Maudie gazed wonderingly out of the window. Suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg&nbsp;342]</span>
she too uttered an exclamation, then drew sharply back
behind the curtains as she announced in excited tones&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, there&#39;s Lord Winborough coming down the road.
He&#39;s making straight for here. I know he&#39;s coming up.
Oh, my word, now what shall I do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack was on the alert in a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord Winborough coming here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, yes. Whatever am I to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why should you do anything? Does it matter?&quot;
queried Jack, considerably puzzled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Matter!&quot; retorted the girl somewhat tartly. &quot;Of
course it does. He knows my father quite well, and he
would be sure to tell him he had met me here. Oh, I shall
get into dad&#39;s black books, and so will auntie. What can
I do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask him not to say anything about it,&quot; suggested Jack
promptly.</p>

<p class="indent">Maudie waxed impatient.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;One can&#39;t do that sort of thing. It would only make
it seem worse. Can&#39;t I hide somewhere? Frankie, I do
think you might have told me he was coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he wasn&#39;t expected till this afternoon. You can&#39;t
blame me,&quot; declared Pallister in expostulation.</p>

<p class="indent">In the midst of this fluster Evarne stood for a minute as
if stunned. Here was an entirely unforeseen <i>contretemps</i>
to be dealt with. Quite heedless of Maudie&#39;s infinitesimal
troubles, she bent all her thoughts on safeguarding her own
situation. What would be the result of this visit? Morris
would most assuredly hold himself released from his
promise of forty-eight hours&#39; silence if he learnt from Geoff
that the forbidden marriage was to be actually celebrated
within that time. Did Geoff intend taking his cousin into
his confidence? She must know that. Concealing every
sign of undue anxiety she whispered&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are we going to tell him about to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She breathed a sigh of relief at the answer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span>
&quot;Not unless it becomes inevitable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t there another way out, Mr. Danvers?&quot; cried the
distracted Maudie.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff came to the rescue.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not take Miss Meridith out by the back entrance,
Pallister? You know&mdash;out into Langthorne Place.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He mustn&#39;t come with me,&quot; declared the girl emphatically.
&quot;I mustn&#39;t have any of you with me. Somebody
would be certain to see us. People one knows always are
about when one doesn&#39;t want them to be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you can go this way by yourself if you like,&quot; said
Geoff; and getting the necessary key, he hastened down
the little passage between the plaster-room and the model&#39;s
dressing-room, and unlocked and unbolted the door at
the end. Then returning he explained&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go down those stairs, and you&#39;ll find yourself in a
corridor. Turn to the left and go straight ahead; take the
second turning on the left again, and on the right you&#39;ll see
another flight of stairs. That is the Langthorne Place
entrance to this block of flats. When you get into the
street, turn to the right, and then the first to the right again
brings you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maudie interposed plaintively.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I forget already what you said first. I&#39;m sure to
get lost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the electric bell rang out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I come with you, and put you safely into a taxi?&quot;
suggested Evarne suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">This offer was accepted with alacrity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that is kind of you, Miss Stornway. You must
think I&#39;m a silly little baby, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne did not listen. She picked up her hat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish he had not come,&quot; she said softly to Geoff as
she inserted hatpins. &quot;Don&#39;t let him talk about me, will
you, or you may quarrel, and I should be so worried about
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span>
Here the bell rang out again&mdash;a long insistent strain.
Evarne stepped hurriedly with Maudie into the little corridor,
closing the studio door after her. Geoff waited a
minute or two to allow them time to get clear away, then
admitted his cousin.</p>

<p class="indent">The course Evarne had thus adopted was indeed prompted
by cowardice, but it was also upheld by policy. At the
sound of Winborough&#39;s first ring, a terrible shudder of
repulsion had thrilled through her every nerve. The
necessity of again beholding that man who stood without
seemed absolutely overwhelming. She clenched her hands
violently at the remembrance of his brutal and gratuitous
insults of the previous evening. Had she the strength, the
fortitude to meet him once more and remain impassive?
She mistrusted herself. Ah, if she only dared flee before
him as Maudie was doing.</p>

<p class="indent">And from this desire had sprung the thought that she
would probably really safeguard her own cause by being
absent at this moment&mdash;that her presence in the studio, far
from being necessary, would be a decided additional menace
to her safety. At the present moment Morris was under a
pledge of silence concerning her; Geoff, too, had a secret
he was not anxious to divulge. Unless provoked by some
exterior event, it was more than probable that her name
would be deliberately avoided by both men. Moreover,
the presence of Jack and Pallister would further suffice to
prevent the cousins willingly introducing a subject that
was likely to lead to contention.</p>

<p class="indent">But were she actually in the room with them, who could
tell what might not result from so painful and awkward
a situation? A hundred unforeseen complications might
easily ensue, leading to defiance, loss of self-control, disregard
of promises, betrayal! No, this precious chance
so innocently offered her by Maudie of getting out of the
place for a time was not to be neglected.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet no sooner had she taken the decisive step than she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span>
half regretted her choice. After all, there had been but
scant time for consideration. Was she indeed acting
wisely? Sudden suspicion clamoured loudly. Was
Morris&#39;s promise to be relied on? Why had he come that
morning? She hesitated, and stood still. A cold fear
seized her, causing her heart to throb still more painfully.
Then, regardless of what her companion might think, she
very softly turned the handle of the studio door, pushed it
an inch or two ajar, and stood listening.</p>

<p class="indent">Winborough was apparently in an amiable frame of
mind. He greeted the three young men with the utmost
friendliness, and after a few desultory remarks concerning
the weather, proceeded to explain the reason of his unexpected
arrival.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not convenient for me to spare any time this
afternoon, Mr. Hardy. I should prefer that you perform
your operations upon me immediately, if possible.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack remained speechless, quite disconcerted by this
unexpected demand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The life-mask?&quot; queried Pallister.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. What do you say, Geoffrey?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly. Just as you choose. Jack has got all the
materials ready and waiting for this afternoon, haven&#39;t
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh yes, indeed I have. I can do it just as well at
once,&quot; assented that young man, finding his tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne waited to hear no more. It was with the most
cordial thanksgivings that she listened to the very simple
explanation of this visit that a moment ago had seemed so
sinister. She sped before the sound of Jack&#39;s approaching
footsteps, locking the outer door very gently with the key
that Geoff had left in the lock.</p>

<p class="indent">The wondering and decidedly shocked Maudie was waiting
patiently outside. Concealing the sick anxiety that
she must feel so long as those two men were together,
Evarne said cheerily&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
&quot;Just fancy, Lord Winborough is going to have his life-mask
taken immediately. Mr. Pallister will be interested.
He is so clever at modelling, isn&#39;t he? I should think he
would be very successful some day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Maudie swallowed the bait, and forbearing to ask awkward
questions, commenced to chatter brightly about
Frankie&#39;s marvellous talents.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus they wended their way downstairs, and gained the
street.</p>

<h2><a name="chXLI" id="chXLI"></a>CHAPTER XLI<br />
<small>HOW &quot;LA BELLE DAME&quot; LED JACK ASTRAY</small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Jack</span> set to work with somewhat feverish ardour to
collect the necessary materials for his task. In a
minute or two Pallister entered the little room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I help in any way?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack glanced up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. You might go and get one of my clean painting-blouses
from the box, and give it to Lord Winborough.
He must put it on, or he will get smothered with this
messy stuff.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pallister obeyed. Shaking out the laundress&#39;s folds,
he laid the clean garment insinuatingly over a chair.
Then noticing that Winborough was standing surveying
the charcoal outline of Maudie, he whistled softly to himself,
made a grimace, and skipped rapidly back to the safety
of the plaster-room. For the nonce Geoff and his cousin
were left alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Oft-times who can tell precisely how it was, or why or
whence a quarrel sprang to life? Geoff was resolved not to
mention Evarne; Winborough was practically bound by
honour to the same course. Yet certain it is that this one
subject&mdash;religiously tabooed, yet all the time uppermost
in both minds&mdash;somehow came to the front. Then a word
taken amiss, a tone of the voice, a glance of the eye, and
hot anger sapped the resolutions of cooler moments. In
the main, both cousins held firm to their original determinations.
Geoff made no mention of the imminence of
his marriage; Winborough guarded his fatal secret loyally.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg&nbsp;348]</span>
But despite this, their voices, raised loud in wrath, penetrated
to the ears of Jack and Pallister in the plaster-room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good gracious, what&#39;s up?&quot; queried Pallister, with a
startled expression. &quot;Do you suppose Lord Winborough
has found out that Maudie has been here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course not. Can&#39;t you guess? I&#39;ll bet anything
you like they&#39;re quarrelling over Geoff&#39;s engagement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They jolly well are quarrelling, aren&#39;t they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should just think so. I wonder what we had better
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is everything ready? How very awkward. We can
hardly intrude in the middle of a family debate, can we?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They remained in doubt, listening with growing concern
to the storm that was raging in the next room. In a few
minutes the question of the course they were to take was
settled for them. The door of the studio opening on to the
little corridor was flung wide, and Winborough&#39;s voice was
heard calling in curt, imperative tones&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Hardy! Mr. Hardy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a bound Jack appeared at the door of the plaster-room.
Winborough&#39;s face was flushed with anger, his
words were brief and final.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Possibly I may write to you about this bust. I&#39;ll
consider the matter. Good-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Waiting for no response, he turned and strode across the
studio to the other door. There he spun round suddenly
on his heel and flung a final threat at Geoff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As to you&mdash;well&mdash;you&#39;ll be convinced of your folly
very shortly. On Thursday morning you will receive a
packet of papers from my lawyer that may serve to bring
you to your senses. After that, I wash my hands of you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So saying, he left the room, and in another moment the
front door had banged behind him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s up,&quot; inquired Pallister with assumed innocence,
entering the studio. &quot;Where&#39;s his lordship gone
to, running off just when we are ready for him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg&nbsp;349]</span>
Geoff made no answer. He sat moodily by the table,
his chin resting upon his clenched hand. He murmured a
few words beneath his breath, but bestowed not the least
attention upon his two companions.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack spoke despondently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m afraid Lord Winborough isn&#39;t going to let me do
that bust after all. Didn&#39;t you hear what he said? That
possibly he would write to me. Only &#39;possibly.&#39; I know
those &#39;possiblies.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pallister&#39;s countenance assumed an expression of incredulous
disgust.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I say&mdash;lost our lord! What&#39;s the matter with
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack remained silent, unable to answer his query. Geoff
pulled himself together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It can&#39;t be helped,&quot; he said briefly. &quot;Winborough
and I have been expressing our candid opinion of one another,
and one of the results is, as Jack surmises, that the
sittings for the bust are indefinitely postponed. Where is
Evarne? Hasn&#39;t she returned yet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I expect she went a little way with Maudie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m glad she didn&#39;t see that brute,&quot; announced Geoff,
going to the window and looking frowningly after the motorcar
that was bearing his cousin swiftly down the road.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a fine old row,&quot; murmured Pallister. Then
keen regret for the abandoned life-mask swept across his
mind, and he cried impulsively: &quot;Oh, I say, though!
What a beastly disappointment it all is. Don&#39;t you think
you&#39;re a jolly nuisance, Geoff, spoiling all our arrangements
so calmly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff turned sharply round at this piece of impertinence,
but ere the angry retort had passed his lips, his eye fell upon
Jack, who was sitting silently apart, both his attitude
and expression betraying the uttermost dejection. Geoff
crossed over and stood before his friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am sorry, Jack,&quot; he said simply.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg&nbsp;350]</span>
&quot;Don&#39;t trouble about me,&quot; was the somewhat sullen
answer. &quot;Luck is always against me&mdash;always has been&mdash;always
will be, I suppose. He won&#39;t write. He was only
doing it to oblige you. Of course I knew that well enough.
Now I shall stick in the mud forever, I suppose. I never
seem to get a chance like other fellows. Well&mdash;never mind!
Don&#39;t let&#39;s talk about it any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here Pallister laid his hand somewhat timidly on Geoff&#39;s
arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to vex you,&quot; he said in a very small
voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Geoff turned his gaze from Jack for a moment. Pallister&#39;s
troubled countenance touched him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; he said with a fleeting smile, at the
same time giving a reassuring pat to the hand that lay on
his arm. Then he forgot all about that youth again, and
looked with worried eyes at his friend once more.</p>

<p class="indent">Jack was dismally wiping his fingers free from plaster.
This task completed, he stood up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I may just as well go home,&quot; he said, &quot;there&#39;s nothing
for me to do here. I&mdash;I shall have to think about what
new piece of work I can commence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What rubbish!&quot; cried Geoff encouragingly, putting
his hands on Jack&#39;s shoulders and giving them an affectionate
squeeze. Then pushing him back into the vacated
seat: &quot;Whatever should you go home for? You can
think quite as well here, you dear old duffer, and we can
help you. I&#39;m awfully sorry about Winborough, though I
know that does no good, does it? But look here, Jack.
I know a few other people of public interest. We&#39;ll find
someone else quite as good for our purpose to fill the
breach. I&#39;ll see to it for you. Now, who shall it be? What
about&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But before he could make any suggestion Pallister
interposed eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, what about himself, Jackie, my boy? Since he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg&nbsp;351]</span>
is going to do such a romantic story-bookish thing as marry
the most beautiful model alive, it will make him a far more
interesting person than old Winborough has been for many
a year. If you could sculpt a bust of Miss Stornway also,
so that you could exhibit the two together at the Academy
or somewhere&mdash;why, everybody would be planking down
their shilling just to see your work; your name would be in
everybody&#39;s mouth; orders would come rolling in; you&#39;d
make your reputation in a day. Now, isn&#39;t that a brilliant
idea of mine? We&#39;re always forgetting the little fact that
Geoff really is an important person. But he is, you know,
both as the rising great artist and as a future peer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack hardly waited for the conclusion of this speech
before he interposed. There was already a fresh note of
hope in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s perfectly true&mdash;it is indeed. Not all that talk
about orders rolling in and reputations made in a day. I
know that sort of thing doesn&#39;t happen. But what he said
about you, Geoff, was true. If you would only sit for me,
it would be every whit as helpful as if Lord Winborough
had done so. As you say, Pallister, even more valuable,
as this marriage with Miss Stornway is quite certain to
arouse interest. Will you consent?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The proposed victim laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t bargain for this,&quot; he declared. &quot;Perhaps,
after all, you had better go home, Jack, and do your thinking
there, away from this young man and his brilliant
ideas!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So even you can&#39;t deny it is a splendid solution of the
difficulty!&quot; declared Pallister gleefully.</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently Jack was of the same way of thinking. The
sullen unhappy expression had entirely vanished from his
features.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please do, Geoff,&quot; he said very earnestly; and this
proved all-sufficient. His friend gave the required promise
without further hesitation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
&quot;But I must warn you,&quot; he went on, &quot;that I am going
away&mdash;out of England&mdash;very soon indeed. It may be
several months before I can sit for you. Hadn&#39;t you better
choose someone else, after all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Jack was adamant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No indeed. But I can take a mask now, can&#39;t I?
Then with its aid I can get well forward without you.
You&#39;ll let me do it at once, won&#39;t you? Everything is
ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know, I can&#39;t stop long. I&#39;ve got to get
down to the City.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But a mask is quite a short job. It can easily be
finished before lunch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was not to be gainsaid, and the afternoon gave more
than sufficient time for Geoff&#39;s other still more urgent
affairs. Thus he gave in with the brief remark&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Set to work, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pallister indulged in a leap of delight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Jack! How do we start? What can I do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First of all, hand Geoff that blouse, while I bring in
the materials.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pallister seized the clean holland overall, and while
Geoff removed his coat and obediently arrayed himself
therein, the youth sped away to lend his indispensable
assistance in the plaster-room.</p>

<p class="indent">Soon all was ready. The long divan was drawn forward.
Geoff lay down, moving his head restlessly until it was
endurably at ease amid the protecting towels. Jack
wrapped further cloths carefully over the fair hair, tucked
yet another round his subject&#39;s neck, then set to work with
cold-cream, quills and cotton wool.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t forget that when you raise your left hand it
means &#39;yes,&#39; and your right means &#39;no,&#39;&quot; he said, as he
proceeded to mix the plaster with warm water. After a
moment he announced, &quot;It&#39;s all ready now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forge ahead, then,&quot; said Geoff cheerfully, as he noisily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span>
and ostentatiously sucked in a last draught of fresh air.
Then he smiled, but seeing the first spoonful of liquid
plaster approaching his face, he shut his eyes quickly, composed
his features, and resigned himself to fate.</p>

<p class="indent">After the first layer was safely on, the two strings that
were required for cutting up the mask were laid in place and
pressed down firmly. Then the remainder of the plaster
was used. Pallister watched every stage with eager
interest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you hear anything now?&quot; he queried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our voices even don&#39;t reach him unless we shout very
loudly, but all the time he is hearing his own heart thud,
thud, thudding. I know!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They waited in silence until the moment should be reached
when the plaster was in a fit condition for Jack to draw up
the two strings and thus divide the mask. As they
sat there a slight tumult was heard in the street
without. It was merely a couple of dogs fighting, yet
under any circumstances Pallister found it impossible to
remain impervious to external excitements. In an instant
he was at the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pooh! I hoped it was a mad dog, but it&#39;s only a silly
fight, and now even that&#39;s over,&quot; he remarked in disgusted
tones.</p>

<p class="indent">He was turning away, when suddenly he stopped short,
bent forward, then beckoned excitedly to Jack.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Do come here! Hurry up and look. Don&#39;t
you dare grumble at your luck again, for I&#39;ll eat
my hat if here isn&#39;t your long-sought &#39;Belle Dame&#39;!
Isn&#39;t that just the red hair and pale little face you
want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In a second Jack was by his side. His glance followed
Pallister&#39;s directing finger, and he positively gasped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; he cried excitedly, staring down into
the street. &quot;It&#39;s exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for!
Pallister, it&#39;s like a dream!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg&nbsp;354]</span>
Undeniably the girl was uncommon&mdash;beautiful in her own
curious style&mdash;individual&mdash;almost peculiar.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But do you think she would pose for you? It&#39;s wildly
unlikely that she should just happen to be a model.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some magnetic wave had apparently drawn the passing
damsel&#39;s attention upwards towards Pallister. She saw him
beckon; saw another masculine figure appear by his side in
response to the summons. She had cast down her eyes
demurely enough and walked on, but at this moment she
looked back, flashing a quick glance upwards over her
shoulder. Seeing the two men gazing as if spellbound at
her retreating figure, she smiled at them. It was a fleeting
smile, wicked and subtle, narrowing her eyes and bringing
alluring dimples into either cheek. Then she passed on
her way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m positive she would sit for you, if you paid her
enough,&quot; commented Pallister sagely. &quot;Hi, there! Hi!&mdash;Miss!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the girl did not hear his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Jack fell away from grace. The hand of ambition
beckoned, and the faint whisperings of duty proved
impotent to stay his following steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go; I must get her!&quot; he declared hoarsely,
shaken from his habitual calm. &quot;My luck will indeed
turn now. I shall win everything from that picture. It
will drive me mad never to paint it. Pallister, you can
keep an eye on Geoff, can&#39;t you? He&#39;s all right; he wants
nothing whatsoever but to be left alone. The mask is
very nearly ready to come off now, but that&#39;s a slow job.
I can&#39;t stop, can I? Geoff won&#39;t be scared by the waiting.
He&#39;s been through it before, you know. You just sit
quietly by him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trust me; I&#39;ll nurse him,&quot; assented Pallister gaily.
&quot;Buck up, old chap, or she&#39;ll be gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the remainder of his sentence was wasted upon the
atmosphere. Jack was already bounding downstairs, every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg&nbsp;355]</span>
other thought excluded from his mind by the mental picture
of a pale-faced girl smiling upwards over her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall succeed now! I shall succeed! I know it&mdash;if
I can get this girl to sit!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus his innermost conviction spoke loudly as he hurried
along the busy street; yet every second the tiny voice of
conscience grew more clamorous and insistent. Under such
urgent stress of circumstances, surely any artist would have
maintained that it was forgivable enough to have thus left
Geoffrey for several minutes longer than was necessary,
in what was certainly an unpleasant and possibly a dangerous
situation! But knowing Frank Pallister, would
not one and all have asserted that under any pretext it
was infamous that Jack should abandon his friend to so
unreliable and careless&mdash;let alone totally inexperienced&mdash;an
assistant?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must go back. Soon&mdash;almost immediately,&quot; Jack
declared within himself; and with his mind torn in two
directions, he hurried on with yet more frantic haste in
pursuit of this long-desired and widely-sought model.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile, heedless of the instructions to sit by Geoff
and watch him, Pallister adopted the more interesting
occupation of following the pursuit from his post of vantage
at the window. He gave Jack an encouraging cheer as that
young man appeared from out the house, rushed through
the garden and along the road. Suddenly the watcher
beheld a state of affairs that filled him with dismay. The
quarry turned out of the main road and continued her
journey down a side-street, while Jack, still hurrying along
the crowded thoroughfare, ran straight over this crossing
without so much as thinking to glance down it in his haste.
He passed it by heedlessly, continuing his now vain journey
onwards.</p>

<p class="indent">Pallister literally danced with distress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He will lose her&mdash;oh, the idiot! Hi, Jack! Jack!
Round that corner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span>
But Jack was much too far off to hear this shout. In an
instant Pallister&#39;s mind was made up. He alone could
save the situation. He made a dash towards the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly he remembered Geoff, and stopped his hurried
rush so abruptly that he slid several yards on the polished
boards. But Frank Pallister, Esq., that youth of energy
and enterprise, was not easily to be baulked when one of
his brilliant ideas was on hand. He sped hastily back to
the couch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hullo, Geoff! I say, Geoff! You all right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The left hand of the prostrate figure was immediately
raised in token of assent. With his mind now perfectly
at ease, Pallister darted downstairs. He was in a glow
of self-appreciation. What resource he showed in all
emergencies! What a truly valuable all-round friend he
was, to be sure!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg&nbsp;357]</span></p>

<h2><a name="chXLII" id="chXLII"></a>CHAPTER XLII<br />
<small><span class="smcap">THE</span> <i>Coup de Grâce</i></small></h2>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Then</span> for a brief space of time the studio remained
deserted, save for the prostrate figure lying
motionless upon the couch. A big blue-bottle fly
buzzed around the open window, flinging itself
at intervals noisily against the glass. From the street
without arose the low hum of passing traffic. Otherwise
a dull, peaceful silence held sway.</p>

<p class="indent">But in the adjoining chamber sat one from whom all
peace was far remote. Even as Pallister had darted down
the front stairs, Evarne had entered from Langthorne
Place and gained the plaster-room. An irresistible force
had drawn her back to the vicinity of her lover and her
enemy; but still unwilling to make her presence known to
them, she had crept softly into the one little room to which
access was possible without entering the studio.</p>

<p class="indent">As she sat there waiting&mdash;waiting for she knew not what&mdash;every
nerve in her body thrilled painfully. Restless
nights and lack of food had rendered her unfitted to cope
with the continuous train of cruel, tearing emotions that
had fallen to her lot that morning. The gnawing anxiety
of the last half-hour had been nigh unendurable. A very
few seconds of this further suspense, this acute nerve-strain,
and she uttered an audible groan, forced from her
lips by both mental and physical distress.</p>

<p class="indent">Startled by the sound, she tried to turn her thoughts
from the present to all that was most bright in the future.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg&nbsp;358]</span>
&quot;So&mdash;we are to be married to-morrow. Oh, Geoff,
Geoff, my darling!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But anxiety and apprehension beset her too closely to
be avoided. Close upon this blissful reflection followed
another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then&mdash;after that&mdash;not only my dear one&#39;s happiness,
but my life&mdash;my very life&mdash;depend upon that vile creature
here, to whom nothing is sacred. Am I doing right by
Geoff? Oh, if I could only rid myself of these doubts!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed and twisted her hands together. Then composed
herself to thought once more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But my mind was fully convinced, my conscience upheld
me surely enough until Morris came. Would to Heaven
the vessel that brought him to England had sunk to
the bottom of the sea, and that he lay silenced forever
beneath the waters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again she sighed. Again she thought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah me! If these were but the times when witches
reigned, gladly would I sell my very soul to the powers of
evil in return for a charm&mdash;a spell&mdash;to ensure that man&#39;s
eternal silence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Under the stress of such desperate desires, she found it
impossible to remain quietly seated. Rising, she moved
restlessly and without object to and fro from end to end
of the little room. Suddenly she noticed that her dress
had brushed against the table, and become slightly soiled
with plaster. It was but a trifling matter, but as she shook
and brushed it clean again, a sudden hot anger burned in
her veins.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is outrageous!&quot; she said fiercely within herself&mdash;&quot;outrageous,
that I should be thus forced to hide, with fear
and trembling, in back rooms! Oh, how I hate that man!
How he degrades me! How he has cursed my life! From
the very first hour we met he has dragged me steadily
downwards, and now&mdash;now&mdash;he is going to use his own sin
to damn all the remainder of my life!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg&nbsp;359]</span>
&quot;Promises&mdash;what does that word mean to Morris Kenyon?
Did he not promise my father to watch over me&mdash;to
guard me&mdash;and how did he keep his word? And what
promises did he not make to me&mdash;oh, again and again!&mdash;in
what tender, earnest tones; and then&mdash;liar, liar!
Morris talking morality to me! What right has he to do
that? What about himself? What injustice, what evil,
equals that of a man&mdash;middle-aged, wise in the world,
strong, clever&mdash;using every advantage to win a young
girl, and then&mdash;then&mdash;pretending that, even in his eyes,
his own success renders the girl, not himself, infamous for
ever?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She clenched her hands violently. The bright colour
that had flooded her cheeks mounted to her temples.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hate him&mdash;I loathe him! But, Heaven, how I fear
him! If he should&mdash;oh, if he dares! If he only dares,
I&#39;ll&mdash;I&#39;ll....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In the heat of this sudden but enduring paroxysm of
anger she lost the power of further thought. Her throat
swelled, and before she could control herself she had given
utterance to a series of half-sobbing, half-moaning cries of
misery and baffled rage. Frantically she pressed both
hands with desperate energy across her lips. She had but
little self-control left; only by physical force could she
possibly stay those cries of fear and anguish.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she stood motionless, glued to the spot by apprehension.
Surely the men in the next room must have
heard that wild lamentation? She strained her ears for
the sound of footsteps. Her breast shook with the convulsive
pantings of rage that is forced to subdue itself.
Every throb of her heart came as a sharp pang.</p>

<p class="indent">No sound&mdash;no sound whatsoever. Suddenly she reeled
against the table, clutching at it for support. A terrible
idea&mdash;a conviction&mdash;had now assailed her. Morris was
doubtless even at this moment telling her secret to his
cousin. Ah&mdash;she knew! A whispered conversation was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg&nbsp;360]</span>
going on in that strangely silent studio. Once again she
was being cruelly betrayed by that man. This was surely
more than flesh and blood could be called upon to endure.</p>

<p class="indent">In an instant all the tigress in her nature sprang eager
and palpitating to the fore. Without a moment&#39;s hesitation
she rushed wildly into the passage, and flung open the door
of the studio.</p>

<p class="indent">On the threshold she stopped short in amazement.
Solitude, save for the prostrate form upon the couch.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wherever are Geoff and Mr. Hardy and Pallister?
Where can they have gone, to leave Morris alone in this
manner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even in the midst of her excitement, a plausible reason
for the absence of at least one of the trio suggested itself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, of course, Geoff had doubtless gone down to
Doctors Commons to get that licence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, shaken by a fresh access of indignation:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And because of this vile creature here it may prove
futile&mdash;a mere piece of waste paper! Or it may turn out
to be really my death-warrant. Oh, my God, I cannot
endure to look at him&mdash;to be beneath the same roof!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then, such are the powers of imagination, that, believing
the man who lay before her to be him whom she
had such ample cause to fear and hate, she instinctively
knit her brows and drew a sharp breath audibly between
her teeth, huddling her hands together on her chest with an
actual shudder of repulsion.</p>

<p class="indent">And verily, even Love&#39;s penetration could scarce be
blamed for not here discerning the truth. Even had Evarne
been told to distinguish between her lover and her enemy
under such conditions, the task would have bordered upon
the impossible. With face and head completely covered,
with hands strangely identical, with height and build so
similar, and yet further disguised by an all-concealing
painting-blouse, the most loving eye might easily have
blundered.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg&nbsp;361]</span>
But Evarne did not doubt&mdash;did not question. The very
last words she had heard spoken in that studio were to the
effect that Morris had come on purpose to submit himself
to this operation. What room, then, was there for suspicion
regarding the identity of this man whose face was
concealed with the plaster mask? Upon the first glance
she averted her eyes, standing trembling. After a minute
of enduring this agony of repulsion she spoke aloud&mdash;unconsciously
aloud&mdash;quite softly to herself. Her voice,
though low, was curiously discordant and hoarse, pulsating
with the powerful emotions that were so rapidly proving
more than she could bear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s wicked&mdash;it&#39;s cruel&mdash;it&#39;s unjust! He will tell
everything after I&#39;m married. He will glory in it. I
know him. He is a devil incarnate! What have we done,
Geoff and I, that we should be tortured here on earth?
Oh, what can I do to save us both&mdash;what can I do? To be
so helpless&mdash;to be driven utterly helpless into a corner like
this&mdash;oh, I can&#39;t&mdash;I can&#39;t endure it! What am I to do?
Tell me&mdash;tell me! I want help&mdash;help of any kind. Is
there nothing Here or There can hear and help me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice faded away. She stood, turning her head
from side to side, looking around wildly. Her brow contracted
itself into deeper furrows. In the silence she unconsciously
bit at her finger-nails, tearing one down to the
quick&mdash;yet she felt no pain.</p>

<p class="indent">Quite suddenly there awoke in her memory an almost
obliterated recollection. Loudly and wrathfully she cried&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sekhet&mdash;you have failed me&mdash;you have forsaken me!
I prayed to you once. Now you must answer my prayer,
for I invoke you. You are great now as ever. I demand
your help&mdash;demand it! How can I ensure that man&#39;s
eternal silence? Tell me&mdash;tell me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stood for a moment with trembling forefinger outstretched,
indicating the motionless form upon the divan.
Did she expect some mystic voice to respond to her appeal?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg&nbsp;362]</span>
No sound broke the silence, save the fly which hummed and
buzzed and flung itself with blind unavailing endeavour
against the window-panes.</p>

<p class="indent">But into her brain&mdash;that poor brain so tortured and
goaded by cruel anxiety, by a bitter insult, by a great,
passionate love threatened with destruction&mdash;sprang the
instinctive thought of that primæval resource:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Death! Death! Only death can bring eternal
silence!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Swiftly, yet very surely, a strange, unfamiliar influence
had enwrapped this rebel against Fate. Who can declare
authoritatively what supreme Power behind the Veil she
had not summoned in that moment&#39;s distraught and reckless
invocation? Be that as it may, she became obsessed
by one of those all-mighty, dominating impulses that conquer
the will, the judgment, even the desire; that crush
down previously accepted ideas of right and wrong, forcing
a fresh, oft-times dreaded, idea masterfully into a shrinking
heart and mind.</p>

<p class="indent">And the message that had come to Evarne was terrible&mdash;terrific!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Call Death to your aid! Kill your enemy! Kill him
while there is yet time!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even through the passion of rage that shook her, she felt
a momentary subduing chill of horror. She pressed her
hands to either cheek, and with strained features, parted
lips and staring, dilated eyes, gazed wildly into vacancy.</p>

<p class="indent">But this horrible inspiration was as a white light suddenly
illuminating the dense dark path along which she
had been groping. She laughed&mdash;a low laugh&mdash;terrible,
for there was no ring of mirth therein.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is only justice&mdash;justice&mdash;justice&mdash;justice!&quot; she
cried, her voice rising upon every word. &quot;He is the devil&#39;s
emissary. The world will be well rid of him. It is justice&mdash;justice&mdash;justice!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had no more consecutive thoughts, no more reflection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg&nbsp;363]</span>
no more hesitation. But one word rang in her mind.
Justice! Justice! Justice! She rushed across the room
with wild haste, and seized upon Andromache&#39;s golden
fetter that lay upon a chair. With anger, fiery indignation
and hatred, terror and mad love raging within her brain,
all other emotions were effectively excluded. Pity,
caution, lawfulness, fear of consequences&mdash;none of these
found any place within her spirit in that dreadful hour.
If the souls of the dead can verily watch over those they
loved in life, broken indeed must be their heavenly peace
and happiness. Rather they must be oft-times in hell.</p>

<p class="indent">Softly she fastened one fetter around a strong portion of
the openwork carved wooden back of the couch; then,
without a moment&#39;s warning, the handcuff at the other end
of the chain was snapped round the nearest wrist of the
prostrate figure. Futile was the immediate startled effort
of the death-doomed man to rise. In an instant Evarne
had dragged away those two quills through which was
drawn the breath of life, and had pressed the still slightly
unset plaster over the tiny holes. Then sinking on her
knees, she seized her victim&#39;s remaining arm, clutching it
to her breast with a desperate vigour.</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes were convulsively shut, her lips parted over
clenched teeth, as for what seemed an interminable period
she was flung to and fro by the frenzied struggles of the
strong arm she held captive. But gradually her task grew
easier. Very soon that dire deed had taken its place amid
the record of things done.</p>

<p class="indent">Cautiously she slackened her grasp. The arm, released,
drooped heavily downwards from its shoulder, the hand
resting inertly upon the floor. Evarne rose to her feet.
Unfastening both ends of the golden fetter, she flung it
back upon the chair, then left the studio without another
glance at the twisted, distorted form of that dead man
whose lips would speak no more words, either of devotion
or of malice.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[pg&nbsp;364]</span>
Deliberately she washed the plaster from her fingers.
Her glance was firm and high, her bearing resolute and undaunted.
Yet, as she dried her hands, she suddenly paused,
and, leaning heavily on the edge of the little sink, uttered
a long, trembling sigh such as can well up only from a cruelly
over-burdened heart&mdash;a low, piteous moan&mdash;a stifled wail
of despair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Geoff, Geoff! What am I? What have I become
for your sake?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She went out again into Langthorne Place and walked
away. Only about five minutes had passed since she trod
that pavement before, yet now...? Her pulses
throbbed wildly, but she was assailed by no regret, no trace
of self-reproach. She was appalled by, yet exalted in,
her desperate deed. She was triumphant. She had conquered!</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Jack, hastily returning, almost collided with Pallister,
who issued from the side-street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So we&#39;ve lost your unique &#39;Belle Dame,&#39; worse luck
to us! And a precious couple we must look out here, with
no hats, and smeared painting-blouses and....&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the remaining words died away at the sight of Jack&#39;s
expression of undisguised alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pallister! You surely haven&#39;t left Geoff alone! How
infamous! Oh, how could you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Without waiting for any answer he darted across the road
and ran with all speed for the studio.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; declared Pallister, somewhat subdued,
hurrying after him. &quot;He&#39;s all right. What&#39;s the
trouble?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, don&#39;t speak to me! How could you leave him?&quot;
was the sole response.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you seem to forget you did it yourself, if it&#39;s
such a crime,&quot; Pallister replied tartly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;More blame to me! But I left him in your charge;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg&nbsp;365]</span>
you left him alone&mdash;surely that makes all the difference.
Good gracious, though&mdash;whatever possessed me? You&#39;re
as irresponsible as a child, and I knew it&mdash;I knew
it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned into the garden, and in a minute was bounding
upstairs, closely followed by the indignant Pallister.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A quarter of an hour later, Evarne, pale yet supremely
beautiful in her blush-rose gown, in her turn mounted the
stairs. As she came in sight of the front door of the flat
she saw that it stood wide open. From it was wafted
faintly a piteous sound of sobbing and wailing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose some will mourn Morris. I did not remember
that,&quot; she reflected, as she entered and closed the front
door behind her. Then, making her way across the hall to
the studio, she went in, inquiring in splendidly feigned
surprise and alarm, &quot;What is the matter? What has
happened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Poor Pallister was lying prostrate on the floor near the
window, his hands, flung over his head, convulsively grasping
great masses of fur that he had torn from the bearskin
rug by which he lay. His whole body was writhing
beneath choking, rending sobs. From him, Evarne slowly
turned her gaze on Jack, who was seated near the couch.
He, too, was shaking violently from head to foot; but as
regards fixity of expression, hue and voluntary action, he
might have been a figure of despair cut from marble.</p>

<p class="indent">A sudden pain darted through Evarne&#39;s brow. Unnerved
by the display of such unexpected and unrestrained
emotion, she was forced to lean against the side of the
doorway for support, while her white face grew paler still.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&mdash;oh, I&mdash;what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">None responded to her incoherent words. A cold chill
encircled her. In the hot studio she shivered as in wintry
weather.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What has happened to Lord Winborough? Oh&mdash;where&#39;s?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg&nbsp;366]</span>
I want him quickly. I must see him, I
tell you. Where is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jack rose from his chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go away&mdash;go away!&quot; he breathed. &quot;I&mdash;I can&#39;t&mdash;you
mustn&#39;t know. Go away!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne was fast losing her forced calmness. She was
assailed by a desperate longing to gain new courage from
the ever-tender eyes of the man who loved her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will go! I want to! I&#39;m frightened here! But
where is Geoff? Tell me, Jack&mdash;tell me! Send for him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Geoff! Geoff!&quot; wailed Pallister.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne gave a violent start, and without moving from
the doorway against which she was leaning, she bent her
body forward in Pallister&#39;s direction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why do you also call for him?&quot; she queried.</p>

<p class="indent">The only response was a farther lament.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Geoff, come back! Oh, Geoff, how could I leave
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still bending forward, she swayed round towards Jack.
Then her reluctant glance wandered from him to the form
upon the couch. The mask had been removed, exposing
a terrible face beneath, distorted somewhat, disfigured
with fearsome livid patches and blue swollen lips. Around
the mouth and nose clung mucus froth.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne choked, struggling with sickness; but suddenly
she sprang forward and seized Jack by the shoulders with
unnatural strength.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you don&#39;t tell me where Geoff is, I&#39;ll&mdash;I&#39;ll&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The menacing tones ceased abruptly, as Jack put out
his shaking hands and grasped her wrists.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see you must be told. Well, then&mdash;this is it! He
took his cousin&#39;s place, Evarne, and we&mdash;we left him alone&mdash;and&mdash;and
something happened!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For one long minute absolute silence reigned within the
room. Pallister ceased sobbing and held his breath.
Evarne did not speak, but stared at Jack with unwinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg&nbsp;367]</span>
gaze. He saw a fearsome change steal over her face.
Every feature seemed to alter, to be transformed under his
very eyes, becoming unrecognisable&mdash;horrible! Without
warning, she pushed him violently away, and with a few
rapid steps was by the side of the dead man. She laid her
hand upon the fair hair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So it is you I have killed, Geoff!&quot; she said, quietly
enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;God in Heaven, what?&quot; shouted Jack at the top of
his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Evarne did not speak, but suddenly plunging her hands
through her damp hair she began to scream&mdash;wild, piercing
shrieks that chilled the blood of those who heard. Nothing
could stay her&mdash;until her voice gave way. Still she
screamed on spasmodically, producing merely horrible and
discordant sounds.</p>

<p class="indent">Loud shouts arose from the street. A policeman&#39;s
shrill whistle blew frantically again and again.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Evarne commenced to laugh, a hoarse, derisive
gurgle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you hear that laughter?&quot; she cried huskily. &quot;It
is Morris Kenyon. It is funny for him, isn&#39;t it? And
it&#39;s&mdash;yes&mdash;I see&mdash;that cat-faced goddess&mdash;Sekhet! So you
all think the game is played out, do you? We&#39;ll see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She clasped her arms around the dead form, pressing it
tightly to her breast. She laid her cheek to Geoff&#39;s, and
so rose with her white, distorted face besmeared and sullied.</p>

<p class="indent">Now loud continuous blows were resounding on the outer
door. The electric bell rang forth unintermittently.</p>

<p class="indent">With swaying steps Evarne crossed the room. Pallister
instinctively shrank back as the terrible spectacle advanced
in his direction. At this a pair of bloodshot eyes
were turned upon him, while a strained voice whispered
calmly enough&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Avoid Sekhet&mdash;tell everyone what I said. Never,
never love too much. It is always dreadful in some way&mdash;always!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg&nbsp;368]</span>
Sooner or later&mdash;always! I must go now and
tell Geoff everything myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, ere they could realise what was next to happen,
she had put one knee on the window-sill and flung up her
arms wildly. Instinctively both men rushed forward, but,
happily, too late!</p>

<p class="indent">In another instant a broken mass lay peacefully unconscious
forever upon the green bosom of Earth&mdash;our Mother.</p>
